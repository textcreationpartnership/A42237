            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Civil Law, whether that, proper to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or that appertaining to any other people, many have endeavoured either to expound by large Commentaries, or to expoſe to preſent view by Epitomies: But of that Law, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns moſt Nations, and the Rulers of diverſe People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ariſe from Nature, or be Inſtituted by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or whether it be introduced by Cuſtome or Tacite Conſent, few have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto treated; and none at all either Univerſally or Methodically:<note place="margin">The uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Treatiſe.</note> though ſuch a Treatiſe would highly conduce to the Benefit of Mankind. <hi>The Excellency of this Science,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, is ſeen in Leagues, Covenants, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Agreement, and Conditions made between diverſe free people, and between Kings of Foreign Nations, and in all the Rights of War and Peace.</hi> Inſomuch, that <hi>Euripides</hi> prefers it before all other knowledge of things either Divine or Humane; ſaying,
<q>
                  <l>It's vain, of Things, of Gods, or Men, to boaſt,</l>
                  <l>Paſt or to come: unleſs what's Juſt thou know'ſt.</l>
               </q> And indeed, ſuch a Treatiſe would be ſo much the more neceſſary,<note place="margin">The Vulgar Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rights of War.</note> by how much we find many as well in this, as in former Ages, contemning this part of Juſtice, as if there were nothing in it but an Empty Name. There is nothing more frequent in every mans mouth, than that of <hi>Euphemus</hi> in <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> To Kings and Cities Imperial, there is nothing Unjuſt, that is Profitable.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 6.</note> And that alſo which the <hi>Athenians</hi> (being then the moſt Potent Party in all <hi>Greece</hi>) told the <hi>Metians, To humane reaſon, thoſe things are Juſt, which an Equal Neceſſity on both ſides impoſeth: otherwiſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ſtronger Party can and will do, the weaker Party muſt ſuffer.</hi> As if it were in the power of Fortune to make Oppreſſion juſt; or, that no Common-wealth could be well governed without Injuſtice. Whereunto
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:49430:3"/> they uſually add, That the Sword is the Common Judge or Arbiter of all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ariſing between Kings and Foreign Nations. Neither is this the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Vulgar only, That all Laws are ſilenced by War; but ſome ſuch like ſayings do often fall from Men otherwiſe Learned and Prudent, whereby this Opinion gathers ſtrength. There being nothing more frequently oppoſed one to another, than Law and Arms: Thus we find them oppoſed in <hi>Enneus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—to gain their Right,</l>
                  <l>Not at the Law, but with their Arms, they fight.</l>
               </q> The like we find in <hi>Horace,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſaith,
<q>Nothing by Law, but All, by Arms, he claims.</q> Old <hi>Antigonus</hi> laught at him, who beholding him buſied in battering the Forts and Cities of his Enemy,<note place="margin">Alber. Gent.</note> preſented him with ſome Commentaries of Juſtice. <hi>Marius</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>That he could not hear the Cry of the Laws, for the Claſhing of Arms. Lyſander</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> laying his hand upon his Sword ſaid,<note place="margin">Plut. Lyſ.</note> 
               <hi>He that knows how to uſe This, is the beſt Judge of the Bounds of Empires.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe was that of <hi>Caeſar, Non eſt Idem tempus Armorum, quod Legum; Arms and Laws do never flouriſh at one and the ſame time. Kings,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, grant many things blindfold, eſpecially in times of War: for no one man, though Juſt, can poſſibly ſatisfie the deſires of ſo many Armed Men; neither can any one man at the ſame time perform the Office of a Good Man, and of a Good General.</hi> Nay, even <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, though otherwiſe very Modeſt, yet would ſay, <hi>Armatus ut Leges cogitem? What do ye tell me of Laws, that am in Arms?</hi> Or as <hi>Plutarch</hi> frames his Anſwer to the <hi>Mamertines, What, will ye never ceaſe to upbraid us with your Laws, whom ye ſee begirt with Swords?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>So eaſily,</hi> ſaith <hi>Curtius, doth War pervert and deſtroy even the very Laws of Nature.</hi> Even among Chriſtian Authors, we find many ſuch like ſayings: That of <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhall ſuffice inſtead of the reſt, <hi>Dolus, Aſperitas, Injuſtitia, propria ſunt Praeliorum negotia; Fraud, Cruelty and Oppreſſion are the proper Imployments of War.</hi> Now they that favour this Opinion, will doubtleſs object againſt me, that of the Comoedian,
<q>
                  <l>If Things uncertain, thou with certain Rules</l>
                  <l>Wilt Guide, thou'lt undertake a Task as Bad,</l>
                  <l>As he that would with Reaſon run ſtark Mad.</l>
               </q> Seeing then it would be to no purpoſe to treat of Right, if there be no ſuch thing; It will very much concern us, to commend and defend this enſuing Diſcourſe, by a brief, but ſound Confutation of this Error.</p>
            <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:49430:3"/>
            <p>But that we may avoid Confuſion in diſputing with a Multitude,<note place="margin">This Error confuted.</note> let us allow them an Advocate; and who fitter than <hi>Carneades,</hi> who arrived at that heighth and perfection of Eloquence, that he could plead as ſtrongly for Error, as for Truth: This man having undertaken to decry Juſtice, eſpecially that part of it which we now defend, could find no Argument more forceable, than this, <hi>Men,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carneades</hi> his Argument againſt Juſtice.</note> 
               <hi>have ordained unto themſelves Laws for Profits ſake, various, according to their ſeveral manners, which alſo they often change with the Times: whereas indeed, there is no Natural Law or Right at all. For all, both Men and other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are by the meer Guidance of Nature, led to ſuch things, as to themſelves are profitable: Wherefore there is either no Juſtice at all; or if there be any, it is extream folly, becauſe it robs it ſelf to enrich others.</hi> But what the Philoſopoer here ſaith, and the Poet after him:
<q>What's Juſt, or Unjuſt, Nature can't diſcern.</q> muſt by no means be admitted: For man indeed, is a living body, but far more excellent than all others, and much more differing from the reſt, than they do one from another; as may eaſily be demonſtrated by many actions,<note place="margin">Man differs from all other Creatures, and how.</note> which are proper only to mankind. Amongſt which, this is one, that he greedily affects Society, that is, Community; yet not any but that which is peaceable, and according to the Model of his Underſtanding, Regular, with thoſe of his own kind; which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Familiarity. <hi>Men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, with men have Society naturally; and why not, ſeeing that Beaſts with Beaſts have the ſame.</hi> And in another place he tells us, <hi>That Nature hath inſtill'd into our minds the very ſeeds of Vertue.</hi> This alſo <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> (that Emperour who was ſo highly famed for his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy) thus teſtifies, <hi>That we were born for Communion, was long ſince apparent: For, Is it not plain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That Nature frames all things in order, when we ſee the worſer things made for the better, and the better things one for another?</hi> That therefore which <hi>Carneades</hi> affirms, That every Creature is by Natural Inſtinct led to ſuch things, as are to it ſelf only profitable, if univerſally taken, is not to be granted: for ſome of the reſt are content to abate ſomewhat of their own profit, partly to their young ones, and partly to others of their own kind: The Proverb intimates as much, when it ſaith, <hi>Canis Caninam non eſt; One Dog will not eat another.</hi> And the Poet confirms it,
<q>
                  <l>Tygers, though fierce, at Peace with Tygers are:<note place="margin">Juveral.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>And every Beaſt will its own Kindred ſpare.</l>
               </q> It was therefore <hi>Philo's</hi> advice, <hi>Let men,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Upon the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> 
               <hi>learn Gratitude from Dumb Beaſts: The Dog will defend his Maſters houſe that feeds him, and oft-times will expoſe himſelf even to death for him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Thus do they in due time diſcharge a neceſſary debt, by reſtoring that, to their Parents in their old Age, which in their Infancy they received from them. Now from whence think ye, do they learn this duty of foſtering their young, but from Nature; being in the ſame manner foſtered themſelves when they are young? And how can they hear this,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philo, and not hide their heads for ſhame, that take no care of their aged Parents, but wilfully neglect them, whom either alone or before all others they ought to ſuſtain? Eſpecially conſidering, that in ſo doing, they cannot be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to give, but only to repay what they owe them: For Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have nothing of their own, but what they derive from their Parents, who either gave it them, out of what was theirs, or by ſome means or other enabled them to get it.</hi>

Take us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, and what are we but a prey to all other creatures; and as ſo many ſacrifices, to appeaſe the hunger or rage of ravenous beaſts? No Blood ſo vile, none ſo eaſily purchaſed as ours. All other creatures are ſufficiently guarded againſt all violence. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born wild and unſociable, comes into the world armed; only man comes naked and infirm, having neither Hoofs, Horns, Claws nor Teeth, to make him to appear terrible to the reſt; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two things Nature hath given him, whereby both to offend others, and to defend himſelf, namely, Reaſon and Society. By theſe, he that being ſingle, is weakeſt of all, becomes Lord and Maſter of all: It is Society that gives him the dominion over all other creatures; it is Society that transfers Empire from one Nation to another, extending it ſelf over the Seas alſo; it is this that mitigates the violence of Diſeaſes; it is this that yields Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to old age; this aſſwageth grief and pain; this makes us ſtrong, valiant, nay, invincible: For as much as we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully crave its aſſiſtance, even againſt Fortune her ſelf.

            <p>From this ſignification of the word Right,<note place="margin">2. More large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> there flows another of a larger extent.

Is is therefore agreeable moſt to humane Nature, according to the meaſure of humane underſtanding, to be guided in thoſe things by a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rightly informed; I mean, ſuch a Judgement, as is not miſ-led, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vain fear, or by the ſweetneſs of ſome inſtant pleaſure; nor yet violently carried away by any Inconſiderate Raſhneſs. For what is manifeſtly repugnant unto ſuch a Judgement is alſo underſtood to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of Humane Nature. And hereunto alſo appertains that Prudent diſpenſation in the diſtribution of ſuch things as properly belong to every perſon or Society, which ſometimes prefers the wiſe before the Ignorant, a neighbour before a ſtranger, and ſometimes the poor before the rich, ſo far forth as every mans Acts, and the nature of the thing will bear: Which many of old reckoned as a part of Right, properly and ſtrictly ſo called; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding that Right, properly ſo named, may have a far different nature, namely in this, That thoſe things which are now one mans, may be permitted to, or accompliſht by another.</p>

<q>What's Juſt and Equal doth from Profit ſpring,</q> if ſpoken properly is not true; For the Law of Nature is the product of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature it ſelf: Which although we ſhould want nothing, yet would, of it ſelf, carry us to a deſire of Humane Society. The Civil Law then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no other Mother, than that very obligation which ariſeth from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which becauſe it derives its Authority from the Law of Nature; Therefore may Nature be ſaid to be (as it were Grand-mother to this Law. But even from the very Law of Nature there ariſeth ſome profit; For God who is the Author of Nature, was willing that every man in himſelf ſingly conſidered, ſhould be infirm and defective of many things conducing to a good life, the more ſtrictly to engage us to affect Society. But it was common profit, I grant, that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Civil Law: For that very Conſociation or Subjection (whereof we have ſpoken) was firſt inſtituted for ſome utility: yea, and they that preſcribe
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:49430:6"/> Laws unto others, either do, or ſhould propoſe ſomething of profit even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But as the Municipal Laws of every City do mainly regard the benefit of that City, even ſo among all, or at leaſt the moſt Cities, there may, nay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are, ſome Laws by common conſent agreed on, which reſpect the benefit not of thoſe particular Cities,<note place="margin">The Law of Nations.</note> but of all in general. And this that we call the Law of Nations, ſo often as we diſtinguiſh that Law from the Law of Nature, which in that Partition <hi>Carneades</hi> made of all Laws into Natural and Civil only, was omitted. Whereas notwithſtanding being to treat of that Right which was between Nations (for he ſubjected his diſcourſe to War and things got by War) he ought moſt eſpecially to have mentioned this Law.

For as by his own Confeſſion, That Citizen is no Fool who obſerves the Civil Laws of the City he lives in, although he (for the reverence he bears unto thoſe Laws) omits ſome things that would be profitable to himſelf: So neither is that a fooliſh people who have not ſo great an eſteem for their own private gain, as for it, to trample upon the Laws Common to all, or to moſt Nations: There being the ſame reaſon for both. For as he that for his preſent profit, ſhall violate the Laws of the Countrey he lives in, doth as much as in him lies, but deſtroy that, which ſhould perpetually defend both him and his, in whatſoever he hath or ſhall acquire; ſo alſo a people in violating the Laws of Nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do but pull down thoſe Bulwarks, that ſhould thenceforth ſecure their own peace and ſafety.<note place="margin">And why. <hi>Lib.</hi> 9.</note> For as <hi>M.

Wherefore neither is that altogether true,
<q>For fear of wrongs, good Laws invented were.</q> As if men were enforced to be juſt for fear of puniſhment only; for this belongs to ſuch Laws and Conſtitutions, as are found out to be moſt expedient for the better execution of this Law.<note place="margin">Coercive Laws invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for mutual defence.</note> As when a multitude of men, finding themſelves ſingly and apart, unable to defend themſelves, ſhall unite and conſpire with their common and joynt forces, to inſtitute and to defend ſuch Laws and Courts of Judicature, as ſhould puniſh thoſe who ſhould attempt to oppreſs them; ſo that what they cannot do ſingly, they may be able to do with an united force.

But not to inſiſt upon what hath been already ſaid, namely, That all Laws were not ordained for Profit only, there is no City ſo ſtrong and of it ſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but may ſometimes ſtand in need of Foreign Aid, either by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or to defend it ſelf, againſt the united forces of many Foreign Nations confederate againſt it: Therefore we ſee, that the moſt potent Princes and States, have always been deſirous of Leagues, which would be of little uſe or force were all Laws and Juſtice confined within the bounds of any one City only.</p>

            <p>Now upon the Reaſons above recited, concluding with my ſelf, that there was a certain Law common among Nations, guiding them as well to, as in the Wars,<note place="margin">The Authors motives to undertake this work.</note> I had many, and thoſe very weighty motives, that induced me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile this Treatiſe of it. For I very well ſaw throughout the Chriſtian World ſo great a licence of making War, and of running into Arms upon every light cauſe, and ſometimes upon none at all, that even the <hi>Barbarians</hi> would have been aſhamed to have owned it.<note place="margin">1. A general licence in making War;</note> And alſo, that Arms being once taken up, there was no reverence at all had to Laws, either Divine or Humane; but juſt as if ſome Fury had been ſent out to kill and deſtroy:<note place="margin">and in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint.</note> ſo War, being begun, a general licence was granted to work all manner of Miſchief whatſoever. The conſideration of which barbarous Cruelty, gave occaſion to many men, not evil, to teach, That it is not lawful for a Chriſtian (whoſe Religion principally conſiſts in promoting Love and Charity amongſt all men) to take Arms: With whom <hi>Ferus</hi> and our Countrey-man <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſeem ſometimes to accord; both of them being great Lovers of Peace,<note place="margin">Eraſmus &amp; Jo. Ferus.</note> Eccleſiaſtical and Civil. But, as I ſuppoſe, with that intent only as we uſually have, when we bend a ſtick, in it ſelf crooked, ſo far to the other ſide, as may probably upon its return make it ſtraight. But this very deſign of too much contradiction, is ſo far from doing good, that it doth much hurt; becauſe that we may eaſily perceive, that their urging of theſe things too far, doth detract from their Authority in other things,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:49430:8"/> though haply true. We ought therefore to moderate between theſe two, as well, that all things may not be admitted to be lawful in War, as that nothing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, another deſign I had, namely,<note place="margin">2. Motive, To promote learning, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Laws.</note> that being unworthily baniſhed mine own Countrey, which with ſo many of my Labours I have honour'd, I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote now by my private Studies, the knowledge of the Laws, which heretofore I practiſed in publick Offices, with as much Integrity as I poſſibly could. Many have endeavoured heretofore, to reduce this into the form of an Art; but none, as yet, have done it. Neither indeed can it be done, unleſs (what no man hath yet taken ſufficient care of) thoſe Laws which are eſtabliſhed by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, be rightly ſeparated from thoſe that are Natural. For the Laws of Nature being alwayes the ſame, may eaſily be collected into an Art: But thoſe that ariſe by Conſtitution, ſeeing that they are both often changed, and are alſo diverſe in diverſe Nations, are put without Art, as the Collections of ſuch things as are ſingular. But if the Doctors of true Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, would but undertake to treat of the parts of Natural and Perpetual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence, ſetting aſide what hath its riſe from the Freedom of the Will; ſo that one would treat of Laws, another of Tributes, another of the Office of a Judge, another of the Conjecture of Wills; and another, of the proofs of Matters of Fact. Then by a Collection of all theſe parts, a Body may be compoſed.</p>
            <p>But what Method we thought fit to uſe,<note place="margin">The Author's Method.</note> we have ſhewed rather in deeds than words, in this Treatiſe, which contains that part of Juriſprudence, which is by far the moſt Noble. For in the firſt Book,<note place="margin">The Subject of the Firſt Book.</note> having diſcovered the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Right; we have handled this General Queſtion, <hi>Whether there be any War that is Lawful?</hi> And next, to the end that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a publick and private War, may be the more eaſily diſcovered, we thought fit to explain the Juſt Rights of the Supream Power, what People may have it, and what Kings: and which of theſe have it, either fully, or in part only. And again, which of them may have it with a Power of Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which otherwiſe: And then we were to ſpeak of the Duty of Subjects towards their Lawful Prince, or to their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Our ſecond Book,<note place="margin">Of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> undertaking to expound all the Cauſes from whence a War may ariſe, ſhews at large, what things are common, and what private; what Right perſons may have over perſons; what obligation ariſeth from Dominion; by what Rule Kingly ſucceſſion is guided; what Right ariſeth from Covenants and Contracts; what Interpretation is to be made of Leagues; what Force, and what Interpretation is to be made of Oaths, both publick and private; what may be due for damages done; what Sanctimony is due to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; what Right to bury the dead; and what the nature of puniſhments are, and the like.</p>
            <p>Our third Book, treating of that which is in War lawful,<note place="margin">Of the Third.</note> and having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed between that which is not puniſhable, or that which among foreign Nations is defended as lawful, and between that which is altogether blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, deſcends afterwards to the ſeveral kinds of Peace; and to all Covenants or Agreements made in War, which appears for this reaſon to be worth our
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:49430:9"/> pains, becauſe (as I have ſaid) no man hath ever yet treated upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and they that have handled the parts of it, have left very much to other mens Induſtry. There is nothing of this ſubject extant from the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, neither of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> (among whom, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Book, Intituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Rights of War</hi>): nor among the Chriſtians, which yet, is a work very deſiderable. Nay, of thoſe Books wrote by the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> concerning their <hi>Fecial Laws,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing traduced unto us, but the bare Name. They that collected the ſumms of ſuch Caſes as they call Caſes of Conſcience; have, as of other things, ſo alſo of War, of Promiſes, of Oathes, and of Reprizals wrote whole Chapters. I have alſo ſeen ſome ſpecial Books written of the Rights of War, partly by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as by <hi>Franciſcus de Victoria, Henricus Gorichemus, Williel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Mathaeus, Johannes de Carthagena;</hi> and partly by Doctors of the Law, as by <hi>Johannes Lupus, Franciſcus Arius, Johannes de Ligna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and <hi>Martinus Laudenſis.</hi> But on ſo Copious an Argument, they all of them ſaid but very little: And moſt of them ſo, that they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded things due by the Law of Nature, things appertaining to the Divine Law, things due by the Law of Nations, and things due by the Civil and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Laws, mixing them altogether, without either order or diſtinction. But what all theſe were moſt defective in, namely, the Light of Hiſtories, the moſt Learned <hi>Faber,</hi> in ſome Chapters of his <hi>Semeſtria</hi> (but ſo far only, as conduced to his purpoſe, and alledging Teſtimonies only) hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupply. So alſo, did <hi>Balthazar Ayala,</hi> but ſomewhat more fully: and <hi>Albertus Gentilis</hi> yet more fully than <hi>Ayala,</hi> whoſe Labours, as I know they may be helpful to others, and confeſs have been to me; ſo what may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, either in the way of Teaching, or in his Method, or in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of queſtions, and of the kinds of diverſe Laws, I leave to the Readers Judgement. This only I ſhall ſay, That in his deciſion of Controverſies, he uſually follows either ſome few examples, not altogether to be allowed; or he is led by the Authority of ſome Modern Lawyers in their Anſwers; many whereof, were framed in favour to their Clients, more than to the Nature of Juſtice and Equity.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes that render a War either Juſt or Unjuſt, are not by <hi>Ayala</hi> ſo much as touched: <hi>Gentilis</hi> hath indeed deſcribed ſome general Heads, in ſuch a way as pleaſeth himſelf. But many places of ſuch Controverſies, as are both Noble and very frequent, he hath not ſo much as glanced at. Now leſt any ſuch ſhould eſcape us, we have adventured to diſcover the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon we may build our judgement, ſo that it may be eaſie to decide any ſuch queſtion, as ſhall happen by us, to be omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Law of Nature how proved, and how diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other Laws.</note>It remains now, that we briefly declare, by whoſe aſſiſtance, and with what care we undertook this Work. And in the firſt place, My care was, to refer the proof of ſuch things as belong to the Law of Nature, to ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are ſo certain and undoubtedly true, that no man without wronging his own judgement, can deny them. For the principles of that Law, if rightly obſerved, are as plain and evident of themſelves almoſt as thoſe we diſcern
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:49430:9"/> with our outward Senſes, which if our Organs be rightly diſpoſed, and other things (thereunto neceſſary) not wanting, cannot deceive us: Therefore <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> brings in <hi>Polynices</hi> aſſerting the righteouſneſs of his own Cauſe, thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Theſe things being plain and regularly due,</l>
               <l>Both Learn'd and Unlearn'd muſt confeſs are true.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Whereunto he preſently adds the Judgment of the <hi>Chorus</hi> (which after the manner of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> conſiſted all of Women) acknowledging the truth of what <hi>Polynices</hi> had ſaid. The ſame Author in another place brings in <hi>Hermione</hi> ſaying,—
<q>We live not like <hi>Barbarians</hi> here, I trow.</q> Whereunto <hi>Andromache</hi> anſwers,
<q>Yet what with them is ill, with us is ſo.</q> For the proof alſo of this Law, I have likewiſe produced the Teſtimonies of Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Poets, and in the laſt place Orators: Not that they are all either equally, or raſhly to be believed, for they ſpeak many things in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to their own Sect, and to the Argument or Cauſe they undertake to defend; but that which many wiſe men, living in ſeveral Ages and in ſeveral places, do all of them affirm to be true and certain; that, I ſay, ought to be referred to ſome univerſal cauſe, which in theſe Queſtions brought by us, can be no other than either ſome inference directly drawn from the very Principles of Nature, or from the common conſent of all Nations. The former ſhews the Law of Nature, the latter the Law of Nations. The difference between theſe is not to be underſtood by the Teſtimonies themſelves,<note place="margin">The Laws of Nature and Nations how diſtinguiſhed.</note> (for the Laws of Nature and Nations are every where by Writers promiſcuouſly uſed) but by the quality of the matter; for that which cannot be deduced from certain Principles, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and concluding Arguments, and yet every where appears to be obſerved, we may conclude hath its riſe or beginning from the freedom of the Will: And therefore I alone have endeavoured to diſtinguiſh theſe two, not only one from another, but both of them from the Civil Law. So alſo in the Law of Nations,<note place="margin">In the Law of Nations that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly right, diſtinguiſhed from that which hath ſome effects of right.</note> I have diſtinguiſhed that which is truly, and in every reſpect Right, from that which hath only got a certain outward effect like unto that of Primitive Right, namely, that it may not lawfully be reſiſted, or, that it ought every where to be defended even by publick force, either by reaſon of ſome profit, or that ſome greater inconveniences may be eſchewed; which how neceſſarily it is to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will appear in the contexture of this enſuing Treatiſe. Nor have I been leſs careful to diſtinguiſh between thoſe things that are Right, ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:49430:10"/> taken, whence ariſeth the obligation to Reſtitution: And thoſe things that are ſo accounted; becauſe to do otherwiſe would be repugnant to ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of Right Reaſon; of which diverſity of Right, we have ſaid ſomewhat already both here and above.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note>Among Philoſophers, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſervedly claims the Preheminence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the order of his Treatiſe, his acute diſtinctions, or the ſtrength and weight of his Reaſons. Only I wiſh that this Principality of his, had not for ſome Ages paſt, degenerated into Tyranny; ſo that Truth (for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> took ſo great pains) finds no greater Oppreſſor than the very Name of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I, as well here as elſewhere, do challenge to my ſelf the liberty of the ancient Chriſtians, who would eſpouſe no Sect of Philoſophers: Not that they were of their Opinion, who held, <hi>That nothing could be known,</hi> (than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurd) but that there was no Sect that could diſcern all Truth, nor any but what held ſomething that was true: Wherefore to collect Truth thus ſcattered, and through ſo many Sects diſperſt into one Body, this, they conceived to be nothing elſe, but to deliver a Doctrine truly Chriſtian. Thus thought <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as appears by the firſt of his Apologeticks, <hi>The Doctrines of</hi> Plato <hi>were not much different from thoſe of Chriſt, nor were they altogether the ſame: So neither were the opinions of the</hi> Stoicks, <hi>Poets, or Hiſtorians; for every one of them having ſome impreſs of Reaſon, ſaw in part, what was conſentaneous thereunto, and ſo far they ſaid what was right. For thoſe very manners,</hi>

               </note> ſaith <hi>St. Auguſtin, which</hi> Cicero <hi>and other Philoſophers ſo highly commended, are both taught and learned in all our Churches now flouriſhing through the world.</hi> And in another place ſpeaking of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi>

               </note> he ſaith, <hi>That ſome few things being corrected, they might paſs for Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not without cauſe that ſome of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and ancient Chriſtians diſſented from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this, That he placed the very nature of Virtue in a mediocrity of Affections and Actions, which being thus placed, drove him to this, That he compacted two ſeveral virtues, namely, Liberality and Parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, into one: And gave unto Truth two Oppoſites, not equally diſtant from it, namely, Vain-boaſting and Diſſimulation; and impoſed the name of Vice upon ſome Things, either not exiſting, or which of themſelves are no vices, as the contempt of Pleaſure and Honour, and a vacuity of Anger againſt men. But that this foundation of his, if taken univerſally, is not rightly laid, will appear even from Juſtice it ſelf, whoſe oppoſites (being too much or too little) when he could not find in the affections and their ſubſequent Actions, he was inforced to ſeek for both in the very things themſelves, about which Juſtice was converſant. Which very thing is in the firſt place to leap from one <hi>Genus</hi> to another, which he deſervedly blames in others: And in the next place, To receive leſs than what is our due, may have ſomewhat of Vice adhering unto it as Circumſtances may happen. For it may be, that what any man ſo abates,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:49430:10"/> he may owe to the relief of either himſelf, or of his Relations. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be repugnant to Juſtice, which wholly conſiſts in abſtaining from what is another mans: Such another fallacy is this, that he would not have Adultery proceeding from Luſt, and Murder proceeding from Anger, to belong properly to Injuſtice; whereas notwithſtanding Injuſtice is nothing elſe but the detention of another mans Right, whether out of Luſt or out of Anger, or out of an unadviſed Charity, or out of an Ambition or Vain-glory (from whence the greateſt injuries do uſually ariſe) it matters not. For to trample upon all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations whatſoever, rather than to diſſolve Humane Society, this truly is the proper work of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But to return from whence we came, True it is that to ſome virtues,<note place="margin">Some vertues require the moderation of our affections.</note> it falls out ſo, that the affections muſt be moderated, but not becauſe it is proper and perpetual to all virtues that they ſhould be ſo; but becauſe Right Reaſon, whereupon Virtue always and every where attends, doth in ſome preſcribe a meaſure to be followed,<note place="margin">Others not.</note> whereas in others it excites to the higheſt degree of what we can do.

               <hi>Of the motions of the Mind, thoſe are ſimply and altogether to be embraced, in which that which is agreeable to our duty, and worthy our choice, is ſound and ſincere. But in thoſe which may haply decline unto evil, we muſt not ſimply and abſolutely follow, but ſo far only as is convenient: Prudence is a pure and uncorrupted good, which none will deny. In Anger, that which ſtirs us up to action is commendable, but that which exceeds moderation, to be avoided as being damagable.</hi> Love God too much we cannot; for Superſtition ſins not in this, that it worſhips God too much, but in that it worſhips him perverſely: Neither can we be ſaid exceſſively to deſire things that are good, and that are eternal, or exceſſively to fear thoſe torments which are everlaſting, nor too much to hate ſin: It was therefore truly ſaid of <hi>Gellius, Some things there are of ſo vaſt extent, that they will admit of no bounds or moderation, and that are ſo much the more praiſe-worthy as they are greater and larger. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> when he had largely diſcourſed of the Affections, ſaid, <hi>Non in his moderandis ſapientiae ratio verſatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>True Wiſdom conſiſts not in the moderation of theſe, but in the cauſes of them; becauſe theſe are moved by ſome things that are without us: Neither ſhould a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint be put principally upon them, becauſe they may be but ſmall in the greateſt crime, and they may be very great without any crime.</hi>

As for examples, The better the Times and the People were, the greater was their Authority; for which reaſon we make choice of the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> rather than of others: Neither do I deſpiſe their judgments, eſpecially when they agree: For the Law of Nature (as we have ſaid)
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:49430:11"/> is in ſome meaſure from hence proved; but the Law of Nations cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved otherwiſe. The Opinions and Sentences of Poets and Orators, are not of ſo great Authority; but yet we ſometimes make uſe of them, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we count them Authentick or Authoritative, but rather as Ornaments to Confirm what otherwiſe we do prove.<note place="margin">The holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> Of the authority of ſuch Books, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men by the afflate of Gods Spirit, have written or approved, we often make uſe, yet with ſome difference between the Old and New Teſtament: The former is by ſome quoted for the very Law of Nature, but without doubt erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, for many things therein do proceed from the free-will and pleaſure of God,<note place="margin">Not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which notwithſtanding is no whit repugnant to the truth of the Law of Nature; and ſo far Arguments may be rightly drawn from thence, ſo that we carefully diſtinguiſh that Law of God, which God by men doth ſometimes execute, and that which men execute among themſelves. We have, as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we could, avoided both this error and another contrary unto it, which is,<note place="margin">The Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament not uſeleſs ſince the New was publiſhed.</note> that after the times of the new Covenant, there is no uſe at all to be made of the Old. As to this we are of a contrary Judgment, as well for what we have already ſaid, as becauſe ſuch is the Nature of the New Law, that whatſoever is commanded in the Old, appertaining to Virtue and good manners, the ſame or much greater is commanded in the New. And after this manner do the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtian Writers make uſe of the Teſtimonies drawn from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But to the right underſtanding of the ſence of the Books of the Old Teſtament, we have no ſmall help from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, eſpecially thoſe who were throughly inſtructed in the language and manners of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The New Teſtament I do alſo make uſe of, to inſtruct Chriſtians in what is lawful for them to do, which cannot be elſewhere learned; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (contrary to what ſome have done) I have diſtinguiſhed from the Law of Nature:<note place="margin">

Neither have I omitted to obſerve, what is rather commended unto us than commanded, that ſo we may underſtand that to do contrary to that which is commanded, is impiety, and renders us lyable to puniſhment; but eagerly to aſpire to that which is moſt excellent, as it argues a noble and generous mind, ſo ſhall it not want its due reward.</p>

               <note place="margin">Canons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.</note>Synodical Canons if they be right, are nothing but Collections drawn from the general ſayings of the Divine Law, and fitted to particular caſes which do uſually happen: Theſe alſo do either point out what the Divine Law doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, or exhort us to that which God commends unto us: <hi>And this is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the true Chriſtian Church, faithfully to traduce unto others what God hath delivered unto her, and after the ſame manner as they were delivered.</hi> But even the Cuſtoms uſed among thoſe ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that were worthy of that Great Name, being either generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or praiſed, are deſervedly to be ranked with the Canons.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Fathers.</note>After theſe, the ſecond Authority is of thoſe who were in their times famous among Chriſtians, for either their pious lives or doctrines, and were as yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:49430:11"/> noted for any great error. For even theſe men alſo ought to be had in good eſteem, as to what, with great aſſeveration, they affirm, and have found out to be true in the interpretation of ſuch places of Scripture as ſeem to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: And the more, by how much both their conſent is the greater, and they draw nearer to the times of the firſt purity, long before any Supremacy was uſurped, or any Sects or Factions known to adulterate the Primitive Truth.</p>
            <p>The School-men that ſucceeded to theſe,<note place="margin">The School-men.</note> do often ſhew the ſtrength of their Wits; But they happened to live in very unhappy times, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of good Arts: No marvel then, if amongſt many things which are in their Writings Commendable, there are ſome that are Pardonable. And yet when they agree in matters of Morality, they ſeldome err, being very quick-ſighted to diſcern what in the ſayings of other men was to be reproved: And yet, even in this very endeavour of theirs to defend their diverſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they furniſh us with great examples of Modeſty, whileſt they contend among themſelves with Reaſons and Arguments; and not, as the Cuſtome now begins, to deface our Books with Reproaches, the ſpurious iſſue of weak and effeminate minds.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of thoſe that profeſs the knowledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws: The firſt are they whoſe pains appear in the Pandect,<note place="margin">The ſorts of Lawyers.
<list>
                     <item>1. The Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dect.</item>
                     <item>2. Codes.</item>
                     <item>3. Novel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</item>
                  </list>
               </note> the Codes of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and in the Novel Conſtitutions. The Second ſort are they who ſucceded to <hi>Irnerius;</hi> as <hi>Acurſius, Bartolus,</hi> and many more, who at that time governed the Courts of Juſtice. The Third ſort are of thoſe who joyned Humane Learning, with the ſtudy of the Laws. To the firſt I confeſs I owe much, as well for the ſolidity of their Arguments to prove that which appertains to the Law of Nature; as alſo for the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they often give, both to that Law, and not much leſs to that of Nations: yet ſo, that even they, as well as others, do often uſe theſe names promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, miſapplying that to the Law of Nations which is in force, but among ſome people only; and that not by any Conſent or Agreement, but becauſe they take it one from another by Imitation or by Chance: Yea, and even thoſe things that belong truly to the Law of Nations, they oft-times handle confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and indiſcreetly, with thoſe that belong to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Chapters of <hi>Captives</hi> and <hi>Poſtliminy.</hi> To diſtinguiſh theſe I have taken great pains.</p>
            <p>The Second ſort,<note place="margin">Second ſort.</note> regardleſs of the Divine Law and Ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, endeavour to determine all Controverſies between Kings or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, aſſuming ſome things from the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Canons. But theſe alſo were often fruſtrated by the infelicity of the times, ſo that they could never attain to the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Laws, although otherwiſe acute enough, to ſearch into the Nature of what was Good and Right: Whereby they often became good Law-makers, though not ſo good Expoſitors of Laws already made. Theſe, therefore, are then to be hearkened unto, when they give Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:49430:12"/> to ſuch a Cuſtome as now paſſeth for the Law of Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Third ſort.</note>But of thoſe of the Third Form, who confine themſelves wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and never, or at leaſt very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, expatiate into that Law that is common, there is but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe to be made to our purpoſe: Theſe men having joyned their School-ſubtilties with the knowledge of the Laws and Canons, abſtain not from the deciding of all Controverſies between Kings and People. Amongſt whom are two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> namely, <hi>Covarruvia</hi> and <hi>Vaſquius:</hi> This latter uſing great Boldneſs; the former much more Modeſty, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſound Judgement. The <hi>French</hi> chuſe rather to interſert Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory with the ſtudy of the Laws: The chief whereof are <hi>Bodine</hi> and <hi>Hottoman:</hi> The former in a continued Treatiſe; the latter in ſome ſcattered Queſtions; whoſe Judgements and Reaſons will often ſupply us with matter to find out the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Three things the Author propoſeth to himſelf eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</note>In this whole Treatiſe I chiefly propoſe to my ſelf Three things: Firſt, To make the Reaſons of my Definitions as evident as I can. Secondly, To diſpoſe the things I am to treat of, into a certain Order and Method. And Thirdly, Clearly to diſtinguiſh thoſe things which ſeem to be the ſame, but are not. I have purpoſely abſtained from that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to another Treatiſe: As from thoſe things which teach us what is of Common uſe to be done; becauſe theſe have an Art peculiar to themſelves, to wit, the Politicks; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly ſo handled by it ſelf, that he mixt nothing of any other Art with it; whereas <hi>Bodine</hi> on the contrary, confounds that Art with this of ours. Yet in many places, I have glanced at that which is profitable: But on the by, and only that I may the more clearly diſtinguiſh it from that which is juſt. Whoſoever thinks that I have any regard to the Controverſies of this age, either thoſe already on foot, or thoſe that may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſeen, will ariſe, do me wrong. For I confeſs truly, That as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians conſider Forms abſtracted from Bodies; ſo I, in treating of Right, have withdrawn my mind from all ſingular facts. As to the Stile,<note place="margin">His Stile.</note> I was unwilling to oppreſs my Reader with a multitude of Words, added to a multitude of Things, to be treated of, whom my purpoſe is only to Inſtruct. Therefore I choſe rather to expreſs my ſelf in as plain and conciſe a way as I could, as being moſt convenient for him that would Teach others: That ſo, they that are to tranſact Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, may at one view, ſee both what kind of Controverſies do uſually ariſe, and by what principles, their Judgements may be guided to determine them: Which once known, it will be no difficult thing to fit their Diſcourſes to the ſubject matter, and to enlarge themſelves upon it as they pleaſe. I have alſo brought in the Ancients ſometimes ſpeaking their own words, whereſoever they ſeem to be ſpoken, either with ſome Gravity, or with ſome ſingular Elegancy: Which I have alſo ſometimes done the <hi>Greeks;</hi> But then eſpecially, when the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:49430:12"/> was either brief, or when I could not ſo gracefully tranſlate it into <hi>Latine:</hi> Which notwithſtanding I have always ſubjoined, for the benefit of thoſe who are not expert in that Dialect. The ſame Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I have herein taken, in judging of the Sentences and Writings of others, the very ſame, I ſay, do I heartily beg and intreat all, into whoſe hands this Book of mine ſhall come, to take in judging of me, and mine. They ſhall not be more ready to Admoniſh me of mine Errors, than I ſhall be to Retract them, and to follow their Advice. And even now at this preſent, If there have fallen from me in this Treatiſe, any thing that is diſſonant to Piety, to Good Manners, to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, if any thing diſagreeing from the conſent of the Catholick Church, or from any Truth whatſoever, I wiſh, with all mine Heart, it had never been ſpoken.</p>

                  <head>II. War defin'd</head>
                  <p>Being therefore to treat of the Rights of War, it concerns us in the firſt place to know what that War is, whereof we are to treat, and then, what that Right is that we ſearch for. War (as <hi>Cicero</hi> defines it) is <hi>Certatio per vim, a Debate by force:</hi> But cuſtom hath Tranſlated the ſignification of the word, from the Act it ſelf, to the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that make War; for as <hi>Philo</hi> well obſerves: <hi>They only are not Enemies that are actually engaged in Battle whether at Sea, or Land, but they alſo, that raiſe Forts, plant Ordnances, or ſuch like Engines of War on their Walls, or Ports, though at preſent they fight not. Servius</hi> upon thoſe words of <hi>Virgil,</hi> concerning <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
                     <q>In War and Arms None greater was than He,</q> makes this diſtinction, By War we underſtand all conſultations and Preparations for War: but by Arms only the uſe or exerciſe of them. Therefore in another place he concludes, <hi>that all that may be reckoned a time of War, wherein either things neceſſary for fight are preparing, or the fight it ſelf laſt; ſo that</hi> War may be defined to be the State or Condition of thoſe that contend by force as ſuch: Which general acception of the word comprehends all the kinds of War whereof we are to treat, not excluding that which ſometimes happens between private perſons as Duels or ſingle Combats, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are precedent to thoſe Wars that are publick, and being of the ſame nature, may well be comprized under the ſame proper name. Which ſenſe the Original word will very well bear, for from the Old word <hi>Duellum</hi> is made this new word <hi>Bellum,</hi> as of <hi>Duonus</hi> is made <hi>Bonus,</hi> and of <hi>Duis, Bis.</hi> Now <hi>Duellum</hi> ſignifies a conteſt between two, in the like ſence as we expreſs Peace by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do <hi>War</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in reſpect of the Multitude of people that are engaged in it; as alſo they ſometimes do by the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in reſpect of thoſe direful effects that attend it.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49430:18"/> though with the wicked they prevail not. To this Law nothing muſt be added, nor any part thereof detracted; and wholly to abrogate it, is impoſſible.

But for our better underſtanding of this Law of Nature, we muſt obſerve, That ſome things are ſaid to belong unto the Law of Nature, not properly, or immediately, but (as the Schoolmen love to ſpeak) by way of reduction, that is,<note place="margin">Some things belong to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by way of Reduction.</note> for as much as the Law of Nature doth not prohibit them: As ſome things are ſaid to be juſt, becauſe they have nothing in them of injuſtice.

And ſometimes by the abuſe of the word, thoſe things which our Reaſon approves to be honeſt, or at leaſt, are ſo Comparatively to thoſe that are oppoſed unto them, though they are not enjoyned us, yet are ſaid to be due by this Natural Law: Moreover we muſt obſerve, that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law doth not determine of ſuch things only, as have no dependence upon Mans will, but of many things alſo which the Common conſent of mankind hath already moulded (as it were) into a Law.

For as <hi>Arrianus</hi> in <hi>Epictetus</hi> rightly argues, <hi>To make a juſt Debt it is not enough, that the money was lent, but it is required that the Obligation remains uncancelled.</hi> So when God commands any man to be put to death, or his Goods to be taken from him, Murther and Theft do not thereby become lawful, for theſe very words do imply ſin; and no ſin can be lawful. But thoſe acts will not amount to Murther or Theft, which are done by the expreſs command of him who is the Soveraign Lord both of our Lives and Fortunes. Laſtly there are ſomethings juſtifiable by the Law of Nature, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but ſo long as the condition of affairs ſtand thus: So till dominion was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the uſe of things was Naturally common; ſo before Laws and Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were eſtabliſhed, by the Law of Nature, it was Lawful to recover by force what was our own, but not ſince.</p>

                  <p>But that any thing may be due by the Law of Nature, is uſually proved two waies, either by Arguments drawn <hi>à priori,</hi> or by ſuch as are drawn <hi>à poſteriori:</hi> Whereof the former ſort are more convincing; the latter more vulgar and plauſible: the proof by the former way is by ſhewing the neceſſary convenience or repugnancy that there is in any thing, with rational and Social Nature; for whatſoever can be proved to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the conſervation of Humane Nature, and Humane ſociety, muſt needs be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a Law by the author of Nature, who is the God of order. That proof which is <hi>à poſtoriori</hi> is, when we can though not demonſtratively, yet with very great probability, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and conclude that to be a Dictate of the Law of Nature, which is unanimouſly believed to be ſo by all, or at leaſt, by the moſt Civilized of all Nations. For if the effect be Univerſal the cauſe muſt needs be ſo to: But of ſo Univerſal a perſwaſion there can be no other cauſe probabily given, than that ſenſe it ſelf which is called common: That of <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath been highly celebrated by many;
<q>
                        <l>What Nations have avow'd,</l>

                     <hi>Quae communiter ita videntur fida ſunt; that which to moſt men ſeems true, may be believed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Heraclitus.</hi> For we can have no ſtronger proof, or evidence of the truth of any thing that cannot be demonſtrated, than the general conſent of the wiſeſt in all Nations that it is ſo. This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> took to be of <hi>all others, the moſt powerful and convincing proof: Si in id quod dicimus omnes conſentiunt; If to what we ſay all men give their conſents.</hi> Of the ſame mind was <hi>Cicero, Whatſoever all Nations do grant muſt, needs be the voice of Nature:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tuſc. Ep.</hi> 117. <hi>Nic. l.</hi> 10. 11.</note> So <hi>Seneca</hi> alſo, <hi>What appears the ſame to all men, muſt undoubtedly be true. He that derogates from this faith can never expect to be believed himſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Quod apud multos unum invenitur, non eſt erratum, ſed traditum; What is approved of by the moſt, is not error but Tradition.</hi> I ſaid before that that muſt needs be a Dictate of Nature that was acknowledged to be ſo by all, or at leaſt, by the moſt Civilized Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deſervedly; <hi>for ſome people are ſo fierce and ſavage that they have hardly any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity among them,</hi> as <hi>Prophyrie</hi> rightly obſerved. <hi>Now no man of ſound judgment ſurely, will impute this as a general reproach to all mankind: Surely this Law of Nature is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the ſame with all mankind that are of ſound and perfect mind:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Andr. Rhod.</note>

The Civil power is that which governs any City: Now a City is a compleat company of free-men, aſſociated for the defence of their own Rights, and for their common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. That Law that is of leſſer extent, and ariſeth not from the Civil Power, though ſubject unto it, is various, comprehending under it that of a Father over his Children, that of a Maſter over his Servants, and the like. That Law which is more extenſive than that which is Civil, is that of Nations, which derives its authority from the joynt conſent of all, or, at leaſt, of many Nations: I ſay of many, becauſe there is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49430:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> hardly any Law beſides that of Nature (which alſo is uſually called the Law of Nations) that is common to all Nations; yea oft-times that which is accounted the Law of Nations in one part of the world, in another is not, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, when we treat of Captivity and Poſtliminy. Now the Law of Nations is proved in the ſame manner as the unwritten Civil Law is, namely by continual uſe, and the teſtimony of men skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Laws; and therefore <hi>Dio Chryſoſtome</hi> calls it the daughter of time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to this purpoſe are the Annals of former ages of ſingular uſe.</p>

And what I ſay here of the whole Law is true alſo of Circumciſion, which was as it were, the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction unto it, with this only difference, That to the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Iſraelites only were bound, but to that of Circumciſion all the poſterity of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And from hence it was, that the <hi>Idumeans</hi> being the off-ſpring of <hi>Eſau, Iſmael,</hi> or <hi>Cetura,</hi> were compelled by the Iſraelites to be circumciſed as both the Jewiſh, and Grecian Hiſtories inform us. Beſides of all other Nations,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> holds true, <hi>Seeing that the Gentiles who have not the Law, do by Nature, the things of the Law;</hi> (that is, by their own manners and Cuſtoms, flowing from the original fountain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) (unleſs any man had rather referr the word, <hi>Nature,</hi> to the words foregoing, thereby oppoſing the Gentiles to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who as ſoon as they were born had their Law inſtilled into them), <hi>theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the Law written in their hearts, their thoughts and Conſciences mutually accuſing or excuſing themſelves.</hi> And that alſo in the 26th verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>If the uncircumciſion keep the Law, ſhall not his uncircumciſion be accounted for Circumciſion.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expound that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> before cited, <hi>The Gentiles by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that is, <hi>by the very Dictates of Right reaſon:</hi> And preſently after <hi>in this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are they to be admired, That they ſtood in no need of the Law to guide them. And that inſtead thereof, they were guided only by the uſe of reaſon and the light of their own Conſciences.</hi> Thus alſo doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> argue againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of his age; <hi>Long,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before</hi> Moſes <hi>wrote the Law in the Tables of ſtone, there was (as I will juſtifie) a Law naturally underſtood and obſerved by the Patriarchs.</hi>

                     </note> And therefore <hi>Ananias</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Joſephus</hi> did rightly inform <hi>Izates Adiabenus, That God might be duly worſhipped and well pleaſed with us, Although we were not circumciſed.</hi> And <hi>Triphon</hi> himſelf grants this to <hi>Juſtin, That there was ſome hopes left him of a better condition, though he did perſiſt in the way of his own Philoſophy.</hi> Now the reaſons why ſo many ſtrangers among the <hi>Jews</hi> were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and thereby obliged to keep the Law, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it) were,<note place="margin">The reaſon why ſtrangers were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.

From hence then we may collect; that we Gentiles ſtand obliged to no part of the Moſaical Law, as a Law properly ſo called, becauſe all obligation beyond that which ariſeth from the Law of Nature, is derived from the will of the Lawgiver. But that it was the will of God, that any other Nation beſides the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be bound by that Law, cannot be made out by any ſolid arguments; we need not therefore, as to our ſelves, prove the abrogation of that Law, becauſe it cannot be ſaid to be abrogated as to them, whom it never bound: yea even to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves the obliging power was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as to the Ceremonial Law, as ſoon as the Evangelical Law began to be promulgated; which was plainly revealed to St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.15.<note place="margin">Acts 10.15.</note> And as to the reſt, after that people ceaſed to be a people by the deſtruction of their City, and that general deſolation that ſucceeded, without any hopes of reſtitution; but we who are ſtrangers are not freed from that Law, by the advent of Chriſt, but by Chriſt we who before had nothing but a faint and obſcure hope, placed only in the goodneſs of God, are now ſtrengthened by a clear and firm Covenant, aſſuring us that we alſo may grow up together with the <hi>Jews,</hi> (being the ſons of the Patriarchs) into one Church, the Judaical Law, (which was that Partition-wall that kept us aſunder) being now taken away, as St <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>

For ſince the Law of Nature is (as I have already ſaid) perpetual, and immutable, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be commanded us by God contrary to this Law, becauſe God can never be unjuſt.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.8.

But as to the permiſſions of the Law we muſt ſpeak of them more diſtinctly: Now legal permiſſion (for that which reſpects the bare fact and ſignifies the removal of impediments only, I ſhall not here meddle with) is either full and perfect, which gives us a right to do ſomethings altogether lawfully; or leſs full and imperfect, which gives us only an impunity with men, and a Right that no man ſhall give us any lawful lett, or impediment in the doing of it.

                  <head>I. The Law of Nature is not againſt it.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus taken a view of the ſprings from whence all Rights flow, let us now begin with the moſt general Queſtion, Whether any War be juſt, or whether it be lawful at any time to make War? But this very queſtion with others that follow are to be dſcuſt in the firſt place by the Law of Nature. <hi>Cicero</hi> in ſeveral places very learnedly proves, out of the books of ſome <hi>Stoicks,</hi> That there are ſome principles inſtill'd into us by Nature her helf, as ſoon as we are born; as to love our ſelves, and to hold nothing dearer unto us, than our ſelves; and in order to the conſervation of that being, that ſhe hath given us, to love and rejoyce in thoſe things which conduce to the ſafety of the whole body, and of every member thereof: and to abhor thoſe things that tend to its deſtruction. Hence it comes, that there is no man but being left to his own choice, had rather that all his members ſhould be proportionable and entire, than by uſe broken or crooked. Therefore our firſt duty (according to Natures inſtinct) is to deſire thoſe things moſt, that are moſt agreeable to our own Nature, and to avoid thoſe that are deſtructive unto it. But theſe things thus known, and reaſon beginning to ſprout forth from her latent ſeeds, then our ſecond duty is to follow ſuch things as are agreeable to reaſon it ſelf, which is ever more to be preferred before thoſe that are convenient to the body; and conſequently to embrace thoſe things that accord with juſtice and honeſty, rather than thoſe whereunto we are led by ſenſe and appetite; becauſe the Principles of our Nature do chiefly commend us to right reaſon, as to our beſt guide and protectrix. <hi>For as Nature in all other things never produceth her beſt and choiceſt, fruits until ſhe arrives at maturity;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Right reaſon is Natures beſt guide. <hi>Sen. Ep.</hi> 124. Ep. 76.121.128.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo neither doth humane nature her ſelf produce her beſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, until reaſon grows up to perfection.</hi> And therefore ſhould Reaſon it ſelf be much dearer unto us, than thoſe things whereby we arrive unto it. Now theſe things being undeniably true, and without any farther demonſtration by all men of ſound judgment granted; it follows that in examining the Law of Nature, we find out, what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe beginnings or firſt principles of Nature: and then that we proceed to that, which though in order of time later, yet is much more worthy to be followed; and that not as accepted only, if it may be granted; but as that, which by all means is to be required. Moreover that which we call, honeſt, according to the diverſity of the matter, is ſometimes taken ſtrictly,<note place="margin">Honeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two waies ſtrictly, as in a point, or largely. For whatſoever may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably done, and yet may be blamleſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</note> ſo as to conſiſt (as I may ſay) in a very point, from which if a man deviate on either ſide, he falls into vice; and ſome times largely, for that which may be commendably done, and yet blameleſly either left undone, or done otherwiſe. Now concerning things honeſt in this latter ſenſe, are all Laws, both divine and humane, converſant, making thoſe things due Debts, which of themſelves are commendable only. Above, when we treated of the Law of Nature, it was queſtioned whether any thing might be done, not unjuſtly: But that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be unjuſt, which had a neceſſary repugnancy to rational and ſocial Nature. Now amongſt the firſt principles of Nature we do not find any thing repugnant to War; nay all things ſeem highly to favour it, for both the ends of War (being the conſervation both of our lives and Limbs, and the acquiring or retaining of what doth neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thereunto) are moſt agreeable to Natural inſtinct. And to do this by force, if neceſſity require it, is a like natural; for why elſe hath nature given unto every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrength, to help and to defend it ſelf? All ſorts of Annimals, ſaith <hi>Xenophon,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in ſome kind of War, having no other inſtructer than Nature.</p>

                     <hi>though it have no Horns.</hi> And in his book of the uſe of the members, he tells us, <hi>That man is a creature, fitted by Nature either for War, or peace; for although he be born unarmed, yet hath Nature given him hands apt to provide, and to make uſe of Arms: which Infants, we ſee, do of their own accord without inſtruction.</hi> It was well obſerved of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>That to all Creatures who want the uſe of reaſon, Nature hath affixed Arms to their bodies, as to the Oxe horns, to the Boar Tusks, to the Lyon claws: But to me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath God aſſigned Arms not affixt to my body, but without it, hereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he intended man for a gentle creature, and that it was not lawful for me at all times to make uſe of ſuch Arms. For as I often lay them aſide, ſo I ſometimes aſſume them, that therefore I may be the more free and at liberty, and not alwaies compell'd to go armed; God though he hath given me Arms, yet hath placed them without me. Ariſtotle</hi> alſo tells us, That hands were given unto man inſtead of a Sword, a Spear, or any other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; becauſe he can thereby make uſe of all. Hence then we may conclude, That in the firſt principles of Nature, there is nothing that is repugnant to War. But if we will examine the Lawfulneſs of War by right reaſon, and the Nature of humane Society, which is the ſecond and moſt perfect rule to judge by; we ſhall plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that all manner of force is not thereby forbidden, but that only which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to humane Society, that is, which invades another mans Right: for the main end whereunto ſuch Societies were at firſt entred into, was that the whole ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it ſelf, that each part thereof ſhould freely enjoy its own, which without much difficulty may be preſumed to have been in force; although that which we now call Dominion had not been introduced. Becauſe our lives, our limbs, and our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had even then been our own, and could not without manifeſt injury have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, or taken from us. So likewiſe, to have made uſe of ſuch things as were then in common, and to have conſum'd as much of them, as was neceſſary to ſuſtain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">To rob ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or than death.</note> had been even then the right of the Occupant. But ſince Dominion hath been either by Law, or cuſtom eſtabliſhed, this is much eaſier to be admitted and underſtood, which I ſhall take leave to expreſs in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s own words<note n="*" place="margin">De offic. l. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>: <hi>To purloyn from another that which is his, or to enrich our ſelves by the ſpoil of others, is more repugnant to Nature, than ſickneſs, poverty, impriſonment, baniſhment, yea than death it ſelf: For it diſſolves that Contignation that there is, or ſhould be betwixt mankind; for if this be admitted, it muſt neceſſarily disjoynt, and break in pieces, that ſweet conſociation that there is between man and man; than which nothing can be more agreeable to humane Nature. If every member of the body ſhould be poſſeſt with this opinion, That it ſhould enjoy better health, if it could attract unto it ſelf the nouriſhment of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber next unto it, and ſhould thereupon do it, would not the whole body languiſh preſently and die? So if it were permitted that what one man ſoweth, another ſhould reap, that what one man planted, another ſhould receive the fruits of, or that one man ſhould enrich himſelf by the ſpoils of another; it is impoſſible that that Society ſhould long ſtand. For as it is moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for every man to love himſelf beſt, and to feed and ſupport himſelf rather than another, with what is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49430:22"/> his own; ſo there can be nothing more unnatural, or abhorring from right reaſon, than for a man to take away from his neighbour that wherewith he ſhould ſuſtain himſelf; or to improve his own Eſtate by the ruin of his Neighbours. Neither is this more agreeable to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations, than it is to the municipal Laws of every City; for to this point do they all ſteer, at this they chiefly collime, this they all of them ſtrictly command and enjojn, That every member of that Society ſhould freely enjoy his own without fear or diſturbance: For by this means is that excellent conjunction and Confederation between them preſerved ſound and intire. And he that willingly breaks this Golden Chain of humane Society, is by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and aſtipulation of all people, adjudged as unworthy of humane Society: and therefore like ſome noxious beaſt is deſervedly proſecuted to Baniſhment, bonds, impriſonment, yea and even to death it ſelf. This then being agreeable to the Laws of Nature, and Nations, and being the end of all municipal Laws, muſt needs be the Dictate of right reaſon, and ſo the voice of God himſelf: whereunto whoſoever willingly conforms himſelf, will certainly ſo moderate his deſires, that he will never covet what is not his own; nor either by force or fraud impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh others for his own private gain; than which nothing can be more unnatural, nothing more unreaſonable, nothing more deſtructive to humane Society.</hi> Neither is it againſt the Nature of humane Society, for a man to provide for himſelf ſo as he do not damnifie his Neighbour; and by conſequence that force which doth not violate another mans right is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: which the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> thus expreſſeth, <hi>Since there are but two ſorts of decertations, the one by arguments, the other by plain force: the former being proper to men, the other to beaſts, we ought to make the latter our refuge, when by the former we cannot prevail.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Quid eſt, quod contra vim fieri ſine vi poſſet?</hi>

                  <p>What I have already laid down, namely, that it is not every War that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law of Nature, may be farther juſtified out of the Sacred Story. For God by his High-Prieſt <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> did approve of the War made by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Confederates, upon thoſe four Kings that came to plunder <hi>Sodom.</hi> Yea and <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſeth God for the Victory; <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be the moſt high God who hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand,</hi> Gen. 14.20. And yet had <hi>Abraham</hi> no ſpecial Commiſſion from God for it; but was excited and perſwaded thereunto by the mere Law of Nature, being himſelf a man not only exceedingly holy, but very wiſe, according to the Teſtimony that <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> give of him. The War made by the Iſraelites upon the ſeven Nations whom God delivered up unto them, I purpoſely omit; becauſe they had a ſpecial warrant from God to make War upon that people, who had highly provoked him: and therefore thoſe Wars are in holy Writ called The Wars of the Lord, being undertaken by Divine not humane authority. More to our purpoſe was that War made by the Iſraelites under the conduct of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who had forceably oppoſed them in their paſſage towards <hi>Canaan;</hi> which though it was not commanded to be done, yet being done was approved of by God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">Exod. 17.14.</note> Nay farther God himſelf preſcribed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> certain general and laſting Rules and Ordinances how he ſhould make War, whereby he ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, That War might ſometimes be juſt,<note place="margin">Deut. 20.10.15.</note> though we have no ſpecial command from God to make this or that War; for there <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a manifeſt difference between the caſe of the ſeven Nations, and the caſe of other people: For theſe they might receive to mercy, but not them. And ſeeing he doth not preſcribe, for what particular cauſes they might make a juſt War, it may reaſonably be preſumed, that thoſe cauſes may eaſily be diſcerned by the very light of Nature: ſuch was the cauſe of the War that <hi>Jephtha</hi> made againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> for the defence of their boundaries, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.

                  <p>By the Law of Nature then, (which may likewiſe be called the Law of Nations) it is evident, that all War is not to be condemned; nor yet by the voluntary Law of Nations, as Hiſtories will ſufficiently inſtruct us, wherein the Laws, Cuſtoms, and manners of all people are faithfully recorded. Nay by the very Law of Nations were Wars introduced, ſaith <hi>Hermogenianus;</hi> ſo he that wrote the lives of men, famous in their ſeveral ages, in that of the life of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> tells us, <hi>That he acknowledged that it was by his advice, that the</hi> Athenians <hi>ſurrounded their City with Walls; which notwithſtanding by the common right of all Nations they might do, whereby to defend their publick and private Gods from the ſury of their enemies.</hi> Yet whereas I ſaid before, that by the Law of Nations War was at the firſt introduced, the words will as I conceive, admit of a better ſenſe, than what at the firſt view they ſeem to import; as namely, that there are ſome certain forms and Ceremonies introduced by the Law of Nations, which by the conſent of Nations do give ſuch and ſuch peculiar effects to ſuch Wars as have them: whence ariſeth that diſtinction whereof we ſhall hereafter make uſe; between a War that is ſolemn by the Law of Nations (which alſo is ſaid to be juſt, that is, full and abſolute) and a War that is not ſolemn, yet ceaſeth not therefore to be juſt, that is, congruous to Right: for even other Wars (ſo as the cauſe be good) the Law of Nations doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approve of, nor yet impugne, as ſhall be ſhewed more at large hereafter. <hi>It is ordained as a Law amongſt all Nations,</hi>

                  <p>But the main queſtion is, Whether it be agreeable to the divine voluntary Law to make War? And here if any ſhall object, that the Law of Nature being immutable, nothing can be decreed by God himſelf contrary to it. I anſwer, that this is true in ſuch things as the Law of Nature doth expreſly either command, or forbid: But not in ſuch things as by the Law of Nature are only lawful, only, that is, tolerated: for ſuch as theſe, becauſe they belong not properly to the Law of Nature, but are without its juriſdiction, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiections anſwered. </seg>
                     </label> may be either commanded, or forbidden. The firſt objection that is brought out of the holy Scriptures againſt War, is that Law given to <hi>Noah</hi> and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5, 6.<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.5, 6.</note> Where God ſpeaks thus: <hi>Surely the blood of your lives will I require, at the hands of every beaſt will I require it; and at the hands of man, at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man. Whoſoever ſhed mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed: for in the image of God made he man.</hi> Some there are that would have the former words of requiring blood, underſtood in the largeſt ſence; and the latter words of ſhedding blood, they would have to be a commination, and not an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; but I like neither. For the prohibition to ſhed blood is of no larger extent, than that in the Moral Law, Thou ſhalt not kill: which doth neither prohibit a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49430:23"/> from putting to death an obſtinate Malefactor, nor doth it forbid a lawful war. Neither doth the one or the other ſo much enjoyn any new thing, as revive and proclaim that old Law of Nature, which through evil cuſtom had been almoſt defaced, where by killing and ſhedding of blood, we are to underſtand ſuch a manner of putting a man to death, as implies ſome vice: As by the word <hi>Homicide</hi> or <hi>Murther,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not every putting a man to death, but the wilful deſtroying of an innocent perſon. But that which follows concerning the ſhedding of blood for blood, is to be underſtood (as I conceive) not ſo much of the bare fact, as of the right to do it, which I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; That every man ſhould ſuffer as much evil from others, as he hath done unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is not naturally unjuſt, according to that old <hi>Rhadamanthaean</hi> Law,
<q>To ſuffer as we do, is juſt and right.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Phalaris</hi> ſhould be tormented in his own Bull, <hi>That he that intended miſchief to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſhould ſuffer the ſame miſchief from another,</hi> is <hi>juſtiſſima patiendi norma,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>The moſt equal rule of ſufferance that can be ordained.</hi> Out of a deep ſence of this natural Equity it was, that <hi>Cain</hi> (his hands yet reeking in his brothers blood) paſt this ſentence upon himſelf; <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever finds me, ſhall kill me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 4.14.</note> But God in the infancy of the world, either by reaſon of the ſcarcity of men, or becauſe this ſin was rarely practiſed, and ſo the leſs need of exemplary puniſhments to deter them, did by an Edict repreſs that which ſeemed naturally to have been lawful, and adjudged the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide to wander as a vagabond, forbidding all men to have any commerce, or to make any contract with him, yet would he not have his life taken from him. Thus alſo did <hi>Plato</hi> ordain among his Laws; and that this puniſhment was much uſed among the ancient Greeks, <hi>Euripides</hi> teſtifies in theſe words:
<q>
                        <l>How wiſely did our Anceſtors decree,</l>
                        <l>That he that guilty was of blood, ſhould flee</l>
                        <l>Far from Commerce, or ſight of men, that he</l>
                        <l>Puniſh'd by flight, rather than death, might be?</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Thucydides: It is very probable that anciently ſmall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments were awarded to great crimes; but at length thoſe being ſlighted, they proceeded to death. Servius</hi> upon the firſt book of <hi>Virgil,</hi> deſcanting upon theſe two words, <hi>Solvetis, Luetis,</hi> ſaith: That theſe words were derived from the payment of money, <hi>Antiquorum enim poenae omnes pecuniariae fuêre: For among the Ancients all puniſhments were pecuniary.</hi> The like we find in <hi>Lactantius, Hitherto it was accounted impious to put men to death, though never ſo wicked;</hi> grounding their conjecture upon that one notable example of <hi>Cain,</hi> That it was not the will of God that <hi>Homicides</hi> ſhould be ſo puniſhed, whereupon it grew at length into a Law; ſo that <hi>Lamech</hi> not long after having committed the like ſin (or rather (if he did commit the like) for <hi>Moſes</hi> his words will bear this ſence) yet by this one example promiſed to himſelf the ſame impunity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.24. Nevertheleſs, though before the Flood, in the age of the Giants, through the remiſneſs of puniſhments men grew ſavage and outragious, killing each other like beaſts; yet when after the flood, the earth was fully ſtockt with men, leſt the ſame licenſe ſhould again increaſe, God thought fit to reſtrain it by a more ſevere puniſhment: So that correcting the lenity of the former age, what nature before judged not unjuſt, he himſelf permitted to be done, namely, that he that ſheds mans blood, ſhould himſelf be put to death, and that he that killed an Homicide, ſhould be held innocent. But afterwards Tribunals being erected, this power for many weighty reaſons was transferred to Judges only; yet ſo, that ſome prints of that ancient cuſtom were to be ſeen, even after <hi>Moſes</hi> his law was given (whereof more ſhall be ſaid anon) as may appear by that right which was granted unto him that was next of kin unto him that had been ſlain: We have <hi>Abraham</hi>'s practice to juſtifie this gloſs, who though he very well knew the Law that God gave unto <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9.6. yet took Arms againſt the four Kings, preſuming on that principle of Nature, that to deſtroy the deſtroyer, was not diſpleaſing to the God of Nature: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Iſraelites to fight the Amalekites, who with Arms oppoſed their paſſage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> having no other warrant for ſo doing, than the bare Law of Nature: For it appears not that in this, as in other like caſes, he conſulted with God at all, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.9.<note place="margin">Exod. 17.9.</note> Whereunto we may likewiſe add, that Capital puniſhments were executed not againſt murther only, but againſt other great crimes; and that not amongſt the Gentiles only, but even among the Patriarchs, as the ſtory of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Thamar</hi> doth clearly evince, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.14.<note place="margin">Gen. 38.14.</note> rationally conjecturing by an Argument drawn from like to like, that it was agreeable to Gods will, that the puniſhment ordained againſt Homicides, might juſtly be inflicted on ſuch as were notoriouſly criminous. For ſome things there are that we equally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49430:24"/> value, as we do our lives, ſuch are our Honour, our Virgin Chaſtity, our Matrimonial Faith, and ſuch things without which our lives cannot be well ſecured; as our reverence to our Prince, without which no ſociety can be preſerved. Now they that offend againſt any of theſe, are no better than Homicides, and are therefore to be equally puniſhed with them. Hence ariſeth that ancient Tradition among the Hebrews, that God gave more laws to <hi>Noah</hi> than were recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who thought it ſufficient to inſert them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe laws which God gave to the Hebrews by himſelf.<note place="margin">Inceſtuous marriages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden before <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </note> Inceſtuous Marriages were certainly forbidden by ſome Law before <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, for which God is ſaid to viſit the Heathen, and to caſt them out; for it had not been accounted as a ſin, and ſo not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by deſolation had there been no law to forbid it; and yet we do not find it in any place expreſly prohibited, until <hi>Moſes</hi> records it as puniſhed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. Among thoſe things that were commanded by God to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> they reckon this, that not only Murther, but Adultery, Inceſt, and violent Rapes were to be puniſhed with death, which ſeems to be confirmed as well by the ſtory of <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.6.<note place="margin">Gen. 20.6.</note> as by the words of holy <hi>Job, Job</hi> 31.11.<note place="margin">Job 31.11.</note> But the law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> adds the reaſons of theſe Capital puniſhments which were no leſs in force among the Gentiles, than among his own people,<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.5.

And it were unreaſonable to think, that God ſhould indulge this favour to the Jews only, that they might defend themſelves by war and puniſh malefactors with death, and at the ſame time forbid it to other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Neither doth it appear that the Prophets were at any time ſent by God, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or reprove either Kings or People for either inflicting Capital puniſhments on Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, or for undertaking a war, merely, as war, as they were to reprove other ſins. But on the contrary, who would not think but that ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi>'s judicial laws were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to carry the ſtamp of the divine Law, thoſe Nations did wiſely and piouſly, who formed their laws according to that original? As queſtionleſs the Greeks, eſpecially the Atticks did, and from them the Romans in their Laws of the twelve Tables. But let this ſuffice to prove that the laws of <hi>Noah</hi> are not ſo to be underſtood as they conceive, who by them would evince all wars to be unlawful.</p>

But equity it ſelf, and common reaſon will inſtruct us thus much, That in publiſhing new Laws we are to reſtrain words too general, and to explain terms too ambiguous; and rather to decline a little from the common acception of the words, than to admit of ſuch a ſenſe of them, as may introduce ſo many miſchiefs and inconveniences with it.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Argument is this, That it cannot be concluded by any probable argument, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>5</label> that the Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ever aboliſhed, till their City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was burnt, and with it, not the form only, but the very hopes of a Commonwealth did utterly vaniſh. For neither doth <hi>Moſes</hi> prefix any term or period to this Law, nor doth Chriſt or his Apoſtles any where declare the ſurceaſing of it; unleſs as it ſeems to be comprehended in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commonwealth: yea rather on the contrary, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That the High Prieſt was conſtituted, that he might judge according to the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts,</hi> 24.3. And Chriſt in the Preface to his pecepts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note> That he came to fulfil the Law, and not to deſtroy it; which words if we referr to the Ceremonial Law, are not difficult to be underſtood: for when the Picture is finiſhed, what need we the foul draught? The Ceremonial Law was fulfilled in him, it conſiſting in Types and ſhadows, whereof the ſubſtance was Chriſt; but how could Chriſt be ſaid to fulfil the Judicial Law, if (as ſome hold) he took it away? And if the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged by the Judicial Law, till the diſſolution of their Commonwealth, it will follow, That the <hi>Jews,</hi> though Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anized, in caſe they had been called to be Magiſtrates, could neither have avoided it, nor have judged otherwiſe, than as <hi>Moſes</hi> had preſcribed. I, truly, having through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed all that can be ſaid, can find no ground at all, why any pious man ſhould expound thoſe words of Chriſt in any other ſenſe: This I acknowledge, that many things were tolerated among the <hi>Jews</hi> before the coming of Chriſt, (whether as to outward impunity, or in reſpect of inward purity alſo, I ſhall not now determine) which Chriſt would not permit in his Diſciples, as for a man to put away his Wife for every offence, and for a man injured, to require revenge by way of Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: but yet between Chriſts precepts, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his permiſſion, there may be ſome difference, but no repugnancy; for, under the Law, if a man did retain his Wife, or if he did remit revenge privately due, he could not be ſaid to break the Law, but to do that which the Law did chiefly require of him. But it is far otherwiſe in a Judge, whom the Law doth not permit, but enjoyn to puniſh a Murtherer with death; which if he do not, he himſelf ſhall be found guilty before God. Now if Chriſt had commanded ſuch a Judge, that he ſhould not adjudge any Malefactor to death, this being contrary to Law, he had diſſolved, and not fulfilled it.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth Argument is drawn from <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, who received the Holy Ghoſt <label type="milestone">

But ſeeing no ſuch precept is extant; certainly it is much more probable, that in this caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ſomewhat would have been ſaid againſt it, if it had been held unlawful, that ſo in after ages, men of that profeſſion might not have pleaded ignorance of the danger incident to that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Now, having thus proved, that after the Chriſtian Law was given, it was lawful to puniſh obſtinate Malefactors with death; I take it to be ſufficiently proved that it is Lawful for Princes to make War, namely againſt ſuch a multitude of offenders, as ſhall by force of Arms infeſt a Nation, who unleſs they be by force ſubdued will never acknowledge their own guilt. For though the power of theſe offenders, and their obſtinate reſolution may be a prudent conſideration to perſwade Princes ſometimes not to execute it; yet certainly, it diminiſheth nothing of their right ſo to puniſh.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49430:26"/> to be underſtood, either under ſome condition as many others are, as that ſuch ſhould be the ſtate of affairs, in caſe all Nations ſhould ſubmit to the yoke of Chriſt, and live according to his Law, whereunto there ſhall nothing be defective on Gods part: for moſt certain it is, that if all were Chriſtians, or all that call themſelves ſo, would live after the rules of Chriſt; there would be no occaſion for Capital puniſhments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no uſe at all of the Sword. So <hi>Juſtin</hi> writes of the Chriſtians in his time, <hi>Non pug namus in hoſtes, We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>fight not againſt enemies: and thus Philo</hi> teſtifies of the Eſſeni, <hi>There is none among them, that make either Javelins, Arrows, Swords, Helmets, or any other inſtruments of War.</hi> So <hi>Chryſoſtome, Si eſſet inter homines qualis oportet dilectio, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las fore poenas capitales; If there were that perfect love among men that there ſhould be, there would be no need at all of Capital puniſhments.

The ſenſe of the words then muſt needs be this: In ſuch things as are not very damageable to our ſelves, we are not too ſtrictly to inſiſt upon our own right, but rather to grant more than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from us, that our patience and readineſs to do good may be known unto all.

But it ſollows, <hi>Give unto him that asks, and from him that would borrow turn not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi> Than which words, if not underſtood with ſome limitation, nothing ſound harſher. <hi>He that takes no care for his Family,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, is worſe than an Infidel:</hi> Let St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf be Judge who was beſt able to expound his Maſters Law, and who exhorting the Corinthians to extend their liberality to the poor at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not that others ſhould be eaſed and you burdened, but that by an equality, your abundance ſhould ſupply their wants:</hi> that is, (to borrow the words of <hi>Livy,</hi> in a caſe not unlike to this) <hi>that out of your ſtore ye may relieve the neceſſities of others.</hi> Dabo egenti, ſed &amp; ipſe non egeam, <hi>I will give to the poor, but ſo, as that thereby I make not my ſelf poor,</hi> ſaith Seneca. So alſo <hi>Chryſoſtom, God requires thoſe things of us that are in our power to give: According to what a man hath,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, and not according to what a man hath not.</hi> And he commends the Theſſalonians, <hi>that they gave above what they were able;</hi> but yet he doth not exact the ſame from the Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians: To the like purpoſe is that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon, What I find ſuperabundant in mine own eſtate, will be ſufficient to relieve the wants of my friends.</hi> By all which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">The indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Hebrew Law.</note> That this precept of our Saviours (as all the reſt which follow in this Chapter) are to be underſtood with ſome equitable limitation, and not barely as the words import: The Hebrew law to prevent the cruelty of Husbands to their Wives, did indulge unto them the liberty of Divorce; and to prevent private revenge, whereunto that Nation was too much addicted, gave liberty to the injured perſon to avenge himſelf, not by his own hand, but by requiring it from the Judges, according to the Rule of Retaliation; which Law was ſo pleaſing to the Romans,<note place="margin">Which Chriſt reforms.</note> that they inſerted it among thoſe in the 12 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Si membrum rupit talio eſto, He that breaks a limb ſhall ſuffer the like.</hi> But Chriſt being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of much more patience, was ſo far from approving this Law, that he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his diſciples to repel ſome injuries either by force or judgment.</p>
                  <p>But what injuries were theſe? Surely ſuch as might eaſily be born, not that patience was not commendable even in the greateſt, but that he was content with ſomewhat a more limited patience: And therefore he inſtanceth only in a box on the Ear, which neither endangers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such is the weakneſs and vanity of mens minds, that they eſteem nothing worſe than a reproach; ſo we may find ſome ſervants, that had rather be beaten with ſtripes, than to take a box on the Ear.</hi> So in another place, <hi>A reproach</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is much leſs than an injury, which we rather complain of than revenge, there being no puniſhment aſſigned unto it by the Law</hi> So he in <hi>Pacuvius, Patior facile injuriam, ſi abſit contumelia; An injury I can eaſily digeſt, provided that it be without contumely.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe alſo is that of <hi>Demoſthenes, The Tongue wounds deeper than the Sword, and ſtripes though grievous, yet are more eaſily born, if not accompanied with reproaches.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> a little after tells us, That grief ariſing from reproach, is an affection or paſſion occaſioned by the humbleneſs of a mind contracting it ſelf, by reaſon of ſome word or deed tending to our diſparagement. Againſt all theſe paſſions which ſeem to invade the tranquillity of the mind, Chriſt fortifies his diſciples only with patience; ſo that in caſe the wrong offered us either in word or deed, do not much hurt us, it is more magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous to overcome them with ſufferance and patience, than to ſeek revenge either by force or Law. And leſt we ſhould be diſcouraged by that vulgar ſaying, <hi>Veterem ferendo injuriam invitas novam; By over calmly bearing an old injury, we do but invite a new:</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour adds, that even the ſecond is rather to be endured, than the firſt either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled or revenged;<note place="margin">De Statuis <hi>1.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The firſt verſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. was annexed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the Chapter fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going againſt taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher powers;</hi> and what there follows, was annexed to thoſe precepts foregoing, againſt taking revenge.

For if we include in that negative precept, that Revenge that is taken by the Magiſtrate for the publick good, what can be more abſurd than after he had charged the Romans, not at all to execute capital puniſhments, to have immediately ſubjoyned, that to this very end God had ordained the higher powers, that they in his ſtead, ſhould execute even Capital Judgments upon Malefactors? for ſo the power of the Sword muſt needs ſignifie, if any thing.</p>

                  <p>When there ariſeth any doubt concerning the ſence of things written, we have two main helps, namely, the common practice of that Age, and the authority of the moſt prudent men, both which are of ſingular uſe for the right underſtanding of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: According to that ancient rule, <hi>Sanctorum praxis, optimus eſt praeceptorum interpres; The practice of the Saints, is the beſt interpreter of our Saviours precepts.</hi> For it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Apoſtles did commit all things ſo clearly to Writing, that might or did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Oeconomy of the Church; but that ſome things were delivered by words only: Neither is it probable, that all the Churches by them eſtabliſhed,<note place="margin">Concerning the ancient Fathers, three things obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> ſhould quickly forget what was ſo delivered unto them and practiſed by them.

Thus <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> forbids a Chriſtian to go to War, not that it was unlawful, but becauſe the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of War did ſometimes enjoyn ſuch acts, as the Diſcipline of Chriſt could not allow of: In the Epiſtle of <hi>Dolobella</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as it is recorded by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> deſire to be exempted from all military expeditions, not ſimply as being unlawful, but that being mixt with ſtrangers, they could not ſufficiently perform the Rites and Ceremonies of their own Law, nor would their Religion permit them to make long marches, or to perform acts of Hoſtility on the Sabbath day: and the ſame <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that for theſe very reaſons, the <hi>Jews</hi> got leave of <hi>L.

(Nay farther, admit that there were ſome places of Scripture which did ſeemingly reſtrain the political uſe of the Sword, yet ſince it hath been accounted by all good men a means ſufficient for the avoiding of perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inconveniences, (as mutilation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to admit of any ſenſe rather than the literal, as of the plucking out of the right eye, the cutting off, of the right hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Much rather ſhould thoſe places of Scripture, that are urged againſt the power of the Sword, admit of any ſenſe; than that it ſhould be thought, that Chriſtianity ſhould deſtroy that, which is the chiefeſt inſtrument of juſtice, the only curb to vice, and one of the main pillars of humane Society. For if it be granted, that the World cannot ſubſiſt without Government, nor any Government without Laws, and that the Laws themſelves ſignifie but little without Coercion: then it is as certain that that Religion cannot be good, that holds forth ſuch doctrine whoſe conſequence will deſtroy all Government; and therefore ſuch a doctrine is to be ſuppreſt with all care and prudence, as the greateſt peſt and nuſance to a Commonwealth: and thoſe very men that did firſt intend by this doctrine to exauctorate Princes and Magiſtrates, would (it is to be feared) be the very firſt, that would take up Arms to abett and eſtabliſh their own wild and exorbitant fancies: And thoſe Princes who ſuffer themſelves to be deluded by them, will quickly find the conſequences to be inconſiſtent with Government; when being diſarmed, they ſhall be diſabled to defend themſelves againſt their Neighbours, to ſuppreſs mutinies and ſeditions at home, or to give that protection unto their own ſubjects againſt rapine and violence, which in honour and Conſcience is due unto them. But let theſe ſuffice to diſſolve thoſe objections that are uſually brought out of holy Writ againſt the lawfulneſs of War; and now let us ſee what may be brought to confirm our opinion, namely, That all War is not unlawful.</p>
                  <p>And here in the firſt place, we may alledge many Authors and thoſe more antient,<note place="margin">Arguments proving ſome Wars lawful</note> who hold, That Chriſtians may lawfuly put to death incorrigible Malefactors, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may make a juſt War; of which <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſhall lead the van, <hi>A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>being called to be a Supream Magiſtrate, as was</hi> Moſes, <hi>is to be unto his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects a living Law, encouraging the juſt with rewards, and reſtraining the unjuſt by ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</hi> And in another place deſcribing the habit of a Chriſtian, he ſaith,<note place="margin">Invitis pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> That it would become him to be unſhod unleſs he be a Souldier. In thoſe Conſtitutions, that are fathered upon <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> we read, <hi>That every putting of men to death is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: but that only which deſtroys an innocent perſon, yet ſo notwithſtanding that the Magiſtrate alone is to determin who are innocent.</hi> But ſetting aſide theſe private authorities, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to thoſe that are publick, that is, of the Church, which in this caſe is of greateſt moment. And this I affirm, That no man was ever rejected from Baptiſm, or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Church becauſe he was a Souldier; which certainly ought to have been done, had War been in conſiſtent with the precepts of the new Law.<note place="margin">Conſt. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>32.</hi>

Tertullian</hi> in his Apology, ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſtians, ſaith, <hi>Navigamus &amp; nos, vobiſcum, &amp; militamus; We both ſail and fight together with you in the ſame Fleet.</hi> A little before he had ſaid, <hi>We, though ſtrangers, do notwithſtanding ſupply all your places and Offices, we fill your Cities, Iſlands, Caſtles, Towns, Councils, yea, and your very Camps.</hi> And in the ſame book, he tells the Emperour <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> That the prayers of his Chriſtian Souldiers had procured from God, Rain in the time of Drought. And in his book, <hi>De Corona,</hi> he commends the Gallantry and Magnanimity of that Souldier, before all his brethren, that had thrown away the Garland when he had won it; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating unto the ſaid Emperor, that he had many other ſuch Chriſtian Souldiers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49430:30"/> we may add, That ſome Souldiers there were that endured Torments even to death for the Chriſtian Faith; and were therefore worthily admitted by the Church to the ſame honour with other Martyrs, amongſt whom he makes mention of three of <hi>Pauls</hi> Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one <hi>Cerealis</hi> under <hi>Decian, Marinus</hi> under the Emperor <hi>Valerian,</hi> 50 Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aurelian, Victor, Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus</hi> with diverſe others. <hi>Cyprian</hi> concerning <hi>Laurentinus</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> both <hi>African</hi> Souldiers, writes thus, <hi>They were once Souldiers fighting under ſecular Princes, but they were alſo true Souldiers of God when by the confeſſion of their faith in Chriſt, they vanquiſhed the Devil, and by their invincible patience under the Croſs were ennobled with the Crown of Martyrdom.</hi> Whereby it is plain what eſteem the Primitive Chriſtians had of Souldiers, even before any of their Emperors under whom they ſerved, became Chriſtians. And if the Chriſtians of thoſe times did expreſs an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to be ſpectators at the execution of Capital puniſhments; it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, conſidering that thoſe puniſhments were but too frequently executed upon their fellow Chriſtians: eſpecially if we add thereunto ſome grains of allowance, for that the Roman Laws were far more ſevere and cruel, than would conſiſt with Chriſtian Lenity: As ſufficiently appears by that one <hi>Silanian</hi> Decree of the Senate; the Rigor whereof was ſomewhat mitigated by the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> as <hi>Spartianus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spartianus.</note> records it. Amongſt which ſevere Laws we may place that which forbad the Teſtimony of any ſervant to be taken unleſs he were tortured. But after that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great began not only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, but to advance Chriſtianity, even then alſo were Capital puniſhments frequently executed. For even <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf (amongſt many others) enacted this Law of ſowing up of Paracides<note place="margin">Paracides.</note> in a ſack, which is yet extant in the Code, under the Title of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of their own Parents or Children; though he was otherwiſe ſo remiſs in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by ſeveral Hiſtorians, it was imputed unto him as a Blemiſh. Yet <hi>Zonaras</hi> gives this Teſtimony of him, That he was very merciful to ſuch as reformed their evil lives: for he would often ſay, <hi>Abſcindendum eſt membrum aegrotans ac putridum, ne ſana contagio cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpat, non id, quod aut ſanatum jam ſit, aut ſaneſcat; That member that is putrid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable is to be cut off, leſt the ſound ſhould be infected, but not that which is either healed, or healing.</hi> Beſides <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had a multitude of Chriſtians in his Army, and (as Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tell us) had the name of Chriſt embroydered on his Banners, and from him it was that the Military Oath was changed into that form extant in <hi>Vigetius,</hi> namely, <hi>By God, by Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt, and by the Majeſty of the Emperor, who according to Gods Ordinance is to be beloved, and reverenced by all mankind.</hi> Neither was there at that time any one Biſhop (that we read of among ſo many that were great ſufferers for Religion) that did ever reprove <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for putting Malefactors to death, or for making of War; or that did upon the account of Religion, deterr Souldiers from their Military duties, though many of them were ſevere Diſciplinarians, ſparing neither Prince nor people, that were defective in their duties. Such was in the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

And yet I am not ignorant that ſometimes Biſhops and other good Chriſtians have often by their Interceſſion turned Capital puniſhments, into Pecuniary Mulcts, or ſome leſſer puniſhments not reaching to life: <hi>Officium ſacerdotis eſt intervenire pro reis;</hi> It is the duty of a Prieſt to interceed for the guilty, ſaith <hi>Aug.</hi> And there is a right introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Cuſtom, That they that flee to the Altar for Sanctuary, are not to be delivered up until faith be given for the ſaving of their lives; and that ſuch as were for miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors delivered to Priſon, ſhould at <hi>Eaſter</hi> be freely releaſed; but he that throughly perpends theſe and ſuch like Cuſtoms, ſhall find, That they proceed rather from minds full fraught with Chriſtian Charity, which watcheth all opportunities and occaſions to do good, than from minds quarrelling at the equity of Capital puniſhments: whence it was that the priviledges of thoſe times and places, yea and the very interceſſions themſelves were moderated with ſome exceptions, as we may learn by <hi>Caſſiodore.</hi> But here ſome will object againſt us the 12th.

But to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this Canon ſo generally, as if it comprehended all manner of going to War, is infinitely againſt reaſon. For the ſame Hiſtorian teſtifies, That many of them that under <hi>Licinius</hi> had laid down their Arms, and whilſt <hi>Licinius</hi> Reigned, did never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume them, becauſe they would not abjure their faith in Chriſt, being by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> left to their own choice, were upon their requeſt, re-admitted. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that urge againſt us the Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> where it is ſaid <hi>to be againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Canons to return into a Secular War, after the Act of Repentance.</hi> But here we muſt underſtand, That from Penitentiaries as well as from Prieſts and Monks, there was required a more ſtrict, and auſtere courſe of life, than what was required from other Chriſtians: That they might be as great examples to others, of Contrition and Humiliation; as they had been before, of prevarication. For as <hi>Leo</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Illicitorum veniam poſtulantem, oportet etiam multis licitis abſtinere; It is but juſt that he that begs pardon for his unlawful acts, ſhould abſtain from ſome things otherwiſe lawful.</hi> So in an Epiſtle wrote by ſome Biſhops to King <hi>Lewis</hi> we read, <hi>Quilibet tanto à ſe licita de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet abſcindere, quantò ſe meminit &amp; illicita perpetraſſe; Every man ought ſo far to abridge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of things lawful, by how much he remembreth that he hath committed ſome things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> So in thoſe ancient Cuſtoms of the Church which to gain the greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence are commended unto us under the name of the Apoſtles Canons, It is decreed <hi>that no Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon ſhould addict himſelf to the War, ſo as to retain the dignity of both Functions, both Civil and Sacerdotal;</hi> But <hi>leaving unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars, <hi>they ſhould give unto God, the things that are Gods.</hi> Whereby it appears that they who were not thought worthy to be admitted to Eccleſiaſtical dignities, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted thoſe that were Military: with this alſo, That none who after Baptiſm had obtained any Office Civil or Military, could be admitted into the Clergy. As may alſo be collected from the ſeveral Epiſtles of <hi>Syncius, Innocentius,</hi> and from the <hi>Toletan</hi> Council. For Clergy men were not choſen out of any ſort of Chriſtians, but out of ſuch as were likely to be exemplary unto others in auſterity of life and manners. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides upon Military Officers, as alſo upon ſome Civil Magiſtrates, there lies a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual obligation: But ſuch as put themſelves into Holy Orders, ought not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with any other care, nor diverted by any other daily Labour. For which cauſe, it was provided by the 6th Canon, <hi>That no Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon ſhould take upon them, any ſecular imployment, nor thruſt themſelves into any publiclk Office.</hi> And by the 6th.

But that which gives the greateſt reputation to our opinion is, the judgement of the Church which we have ſet down in the third Canon of the firſt Council of <hi>Arles</hi> which was held under <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> The words ſound thus, <hi>Concerning thoſe that caſt away their Arms in the time of peace, it pleaſeth the Synod, that they ſhould be debared from the Communion:</hi> that is, They that lay aſide their Arms when there is no perſecution that threatens them, for by the word, <hi>Peace,</hi> the Primitive Chriſtians underſtood <hi>only a vacancy from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as appears by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others; <hi>Noſtrae paci, quod eſt bellum quam perſecutio?

                  <head>I. War divided.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt and moſt neceſſary diviſion of War is this, That ſome are Publick, and ſome Private, and ſome mixt. Publick is that which is made by publick Authority; and Private is that when the Authority is ſo; and mixt when it is in part Publick, and in part Private: and Firſt, Let us treat of that which is Private, as being moſt ancient, That by the Law of Nature ſome Private War may lawfully be waged is, as I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently proved by what hath been already ſaid, where it was ſhewed, That to repel force with force, was no ways repugnant to Natural equity. But the Queſtion will be, Whetherſince the erection of Courts of Juſtice, it be now lawful to repel force with force? Whereunto I anſwer, That although Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature were not inſtituted by Nature, but by humane Authority: yet doth natural reaſon, and Common equity inſtruct us, That it is more agreeable to common Honeſty, and to the conſervation of peace and tranquillity amongſt men, that all differences ſhould be publickly ſcanned, and determined by perſons that are unconcerned; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by them, who being blinded with ſelf-love, do oft-times miſtake right for wrong, and will do that only which ſeems good in their own eyes: <hi>Non eſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis concedendum quod per magiſtratum publice poſſit fieri,</hi>

                     <hi>ne occaſio ſit majoris tumultus faciendi; That is not to be granted to every private man, that may be done publickly by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, leſt for every petty injury men run into Tumults.</hi> And hence it is,<note place="margin">Caſſiod. l, <hi>4,</hi> Var.

                     </note> ſaith King <hi>Theodorick, That ſo great a reverence is due to the Law, that no man ought to revenge himſelf with his own hand, or by the ſuggeſtion of his own paſſions. For if all differences may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by plan force, wherein would a calm peace differ from the tumults of War?</hi> And therefore the Laws call that Force, <hi>When any man takes that which is his due with his own hands, without the determination of a Judge.</hi>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49430:32"/>
                  <head>II. That Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, all war is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</head>
                  <p>Moſt certain it is, That the Licence which before Tribunals were eſtabliſhed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was permitted, is ſince much reſtrained: And yet in ſome places the ſame Licence ſtill remaineth, namely, where Judgment cannot be had againſt offenders. For the Law in prohibiting a man to take his own, unleſs it be judicially, doth tacitely imply that it be in ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time where an ordinary courſe of Juſtice may be had.</p>
                  <p>Now Judgment ceaſeth either for a while only, or for continuance: For a while, when the Judge cannot be ſo long waited for without certain danger and damage. <hi>Servius</hi> upon theſe words of <hi>Virgil, Injicere manum parcae,</hi> The Fates have ſnatcht him hence, tells us, That the Poet makes uſe of a Phraſe borrowed from the Law: for it is called <hi>Injectio manus,</hi> the ſnatching away of a thing, as it were by force, when without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the warrant of Authority, we ſuddenly ſeize upon ſomething that is our due, which is uſually done when the Laws do for a while ceaſe, And ſometimes there is a total and continued ceſſation of Judgment, and that either by Right or in Fact. By Right, as in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are deſert and unoccupied, on the Seas and in Iſlands not inhabited, and in any other ſuch places wherein are not civil Societies. In Fact, as when Subjects do not regard the Sentence of the Judge, or the Judge publickly refuſes to examine the caſe. Now what we ſaid before, namely, that ſince publick Judicatories were eſtabliſhed, all Private Wars are not repugnant to the Law of Nature; is clearly evinced by the Law given to the Jews,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.2.</note> where God gives this charge by <hi>Moſes, If a Thief be found breaking up (i. e.</hi> by night) <hi>and be ſmitten that he dye, there ſhall be no blood ſhed for him; but if the Sun be riſen upon him, there ſhall be blood ſhed for him.</hi> Certainly this Law ſo accurately diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the time when the offence was committed, ſeems not only to induce an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, but ſerves to explain even the Law of Nature; being not ſo much grounded on any one particular Divine Precept, as indeed upon common equity, which guided other Nations alſo to do the like.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Solon</hi>'s Law.</note> The old Attick Law was this, If any man ſhall ſteal in the day time, to above the value of fifty Drachmaes, let him be tryed by eleven men: But if a man ſhall ſteal to the ſmalleſt value in the night, he may lawfully be killed. This ancient Law of <hi>Solon</hi> doubtleſs occaſioned that of the twelve Tables among the <hi>Romans. Si nox furtum faxit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vide infra Bo. <hi>2.</hi> ch. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>ſi furem aliquis occiſit, jure caeſus eſto; If any man ſhall kill a Thief rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in the night, he ſhall be held innocent.</hi> So by the Laws of all Nations that as yet we have known, He that by Arms ſhall defend himſelf againſt him that attempts to take away his life, is accounted guiltleſs; which ſo plain a conſent doth evidently aſſure us, that there is nothing in it repugnant to the Law of Nature.</p>

                  <head>III. Neither is it repugnant to the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law.</head>
                  <p>But whether this private war be juſtifiable by the more perfect Law of the Goſpel, is ſomewhat more doubtful: I dare not but grant that Almighty God, who hath a much greater power over lives than we have, might have impoſed upon us ſuch an unlimited patience, that even privately, in a caſe of imminent danger, we ought rather to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led than to kill. But whether it be his pleaſure thus ſtrictly to tye us up, is the thing in queſtion. There are two places of Scripture that ſeem to favour the Affirmative, which we quoted above when we handled the general queſtion: The former was that in the fifth of <hi>Mat. v.</hi> 39.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.39.</note> 
                     <hi>Reſiſt not him that doth thee an injury:</hi> And the latter that in the twelfth to the <hi>Rom. v.</hi> 19. <hi>Dearly Beloved, Avenge not your ſelves;</hi> which the Latin Tranſlation renders, <hi>Defend not your ſelves.</hi> But a third may be added, namely that of Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.52.</note> 
                     <hi>Put up thy Sword into the Sheath, for they that take the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> Some there are likewiſe that urge the example of Chriſt himſelf, who dyed for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. Neither are there wanting among the Ancients, ſome, who although they do not diſallow of publick War, yet believed that all private, even that which is defenſive was forbidden. Some places out of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> for war we alledged above, but many more and much clearer, and more generally known, may be produced out of St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi>

                     </note> But yet the ſame <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in another place ſaith, <hi>That haply therefore Chriſt ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>when he ſhewed him two Swords, It is enough: As if till the Goſpel came it had been lawful, that ſo there might be, as in the Law the doctrine of Equity, ſo in the Goſpel the doctrine of Verity.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49430:32"/> not obliged to ſuch an height of patience: We are indeed commanded by the Chriſtian Law, to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, but not above our ſelves; ſo that when we are both of us involved in the ſame, or in equal danger, we are no where forbid to preſer our own ſafety before anothers; as we have already proved by the Rules St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to Chriſtian Beneficence, and which <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> in the duties or offices of Friendſhip likewiſe confirms. <hi>There is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither Law nor Reaſon,</hi>

To this we anſwer, That it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he that is aſſaulted may ſtand in as much need of time to repent in; and that the Aggreſſor may alſo have ſpace ſufficient before he dye, to do the ſame. Beſides, That danger into which a man wilfully caſts himſelf, and out of which he may (if he pleaſe) redeem himſelf, ſeems not in any Moral Judgment to be much eſteemed.<note place="margin">Some of the Apoſtles in Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Swords.</note> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, That ſome of the Apoſtles even to the laſt time, and in the preſence and in the very ſight of Chriſt, ſeemed to travel begirt with Swords; and ſo alſo did other Galilaeans journeying out of their own Country towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (the High-ways being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with Thieves, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us;) So alſo did the Eſſenes, the moſt harmleſs of all men, as the ſame Hiſtorian records it.

Beſides, what Chriſt then ſaid, although in truth it was not a Precept but a Prophecy, foretelling thoſe many dangers that were then at hand, (as appears by that oppoſition which theſe words have unto thoſe in the 35th verſe, which ſpeaks of the firſt times which were ſecure and proſperous times, wherein they needed neither Money nor Swords, whereas in theſe later times that were approaching, they ſhould have need of both) yet was it ſuch, as ſeems to be taken from that which was then wont to be done, and which the Apoſtles might lawfully do. It was well ſaid of <hi>Cicero, Gladios habere certe non liceret ſi uti illis nullo pacto liceret; Surely it were utterly unlawful for Chriſtians to have Swords, if it were altogether unlawful for them to uſe them.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Put up thy Sword, expl.</note> It doth indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the uſe of the Sword at that time for revenge, but not at other times in caſes of neceſſary defence: Neither indeed had <hi>Peter</hi> at that time any need of Defence; for Chriſt had already interceded for his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Suffer theſe to go away, Jo.</hi> 18.8, 9. Nor had Chriſt himſelf any need of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sword: <hi>For thinkeſt thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall ſend me more than ten Legions of Angels?</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he then be defended, for he thus infers, <hi>Shall I not drink of the Cup that my Father hath given me? ver.</hi> 11. And ſo in <hi>Mat. How then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> Whence we may conclude, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at that time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49430:33"/> with an eager deſire of Revenge, (being very hot and zealous) and not of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence only: Whereunto we may add, That <hi>Peter</hi> did make uſe of his Sword againſt thoſe that came armed againſt Chriſt with publick Authority. Now whether any caſe will juſtifie our reſiſtance of thoſe that are thus armed, is a peculiar queſtion hereafter to be particularly handled: And whereas Chriſt adds theſe words, <hi>They that take the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword;</hi> it was either Proverbially ſpoken, to ſhew that blood requires blood, and conſequently that the uſe of Arms was never without peril; or rather as <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Patience to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Revenge.</note> 
                     <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and others interpret the place, it ſhews that we ſhould not be too raſh in taking the Sword of Vengeance out of Gods hands, who will certainly in his own time reply blood with blood. And in this ſence it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.10. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity, ſhall go into Captivity; He that killeth with the Sword, ſhall be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Sword; Here is the patience and faith of the Saints;</hi> very conſonant whereunto is that of <hi>Tertullian, So fit is God to be truſted with thy patience; that if thou ſhalt commit thy ſufferings unto him, he will be thine Avenger: If thy grief and pain, he will be thy Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; If thou truſt him with thy Death, he will raiſe thee up again: O how great a power hath patience, that is able to make God himſelf to become our Debtor!</hi> Beſides, In theſe words of Chriſt, there ſeems to be coucht a Prophecy of thoſe puniſhments, which God would take of the blood thirſty Jews by the Sword of the Romans. But as to the example of Chriſts dying for his enemies, it may be thus anſwered: Though all Chriſts actions upon Earth were full of vertue and goodneſs, and ſuch as may be (ſo far forth as humane frailty will permit) laudably imitated by us, and that cannot want their reward; yet were they not all ſuch as were done, either in obedience to any Law; or being done, are obliging, as a Law unto us. For that Chriſt dyed for the wicked, and for his enemies, was not by the Command of any Law, but by a ſpecial agreement and Covenant with the Father, who had promiſed that for his ſo doing, <hi>He would not only exalt him in glory, far above all Principalities and Powers in Heaven or Earth;</hi> but that he would build him alſo a Church, an holy Seed, that ſhould endure for ever, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.10. But this fact of Chriſt was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſingular, and not to be parallel'd, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7. And Chriſt indeed bids us to expoſe our lives to peril, yet not for every man, but only for the Brethren, that is, for thoſe that profeſs the ſame Faith with our ſelves, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16.</p>

                     </note> that are not ſolemn. Now that a war be ſolemn according to the Law of Nations, two things are requiſite: Firſt, That it be on both ſides made by the Authority of thoſe who in their reſpective Cities have the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power: And next, That it be waged with ſuch Rites and Formalities as the Law of Nations requires, whereof we ſhall diſcourſe in its proper place. And becauſe theſe are joyntly requiſite, therefore the one without the other is not ſufficient: That pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick war which we call leſs ſolemn,<note place="margin">Leſs Solemn.</note> may be both defective in theſe rites, and alſo be made againſt private men, and that by the Authory of any Magiſtrate. And truly if we conſider the thing it ſelf without regard to the Civil Law, every Magiſtrate as he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the peoples ſafety, ſo (in caſe any violence be offered) is he entruſted with the exerciſe of that power and juriſdiction, and conſequently hath a power to make war. But becauſe by war the whole City is endangered, therefore it is provided by the Laws of almoſt all Nations, That no war be made but by the Authority of him who hath the ſupreme power in that City.<note place="margin">De legibus ult.</note> Such a Law we find extant in <hi>Plato,</hi> and by the Roman

There is an ancient Conſtitution extant in the Code of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> made by <hi>Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> which runs thus: <hi>Let no man preſume to raiſe an Army without ſpecial warrant, or to make War without our knowledg and advice.</hi> Pertinent whereunto is that of St. <hi>Auguſtin, That Natural Order which is beſt accommodated to the preſervation of humane peace, requires that the Counſel and determination of raiſing of War, ſhould remain in the power of Princes.</hi> Now as all other Rules, be they never ſo general, muſt admit of equity to be their Interpreter, ſo muſt this Law. Firſt then, It cannot well be doubted, but that it is lawful for him to whom the Lieutenancy of any City is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to reduce into obedience, by his Officers, ſome few Rebels; ſo as it require not any great force to do it, nor much endangers the City wherein he preſides.

Upon the preſumption of this Right it was, that <hi>L.

Nay even beyond theſe caſes of Neceſſity, If a King do neglect to revenge the injuries of his Subjects, <hi>Franciſcus de Victoria</hi> is ſo bold as to transfer the right of making War upon the Citizens: But herein he walks by himſelf, for by all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Writers this opinion is rejected as dangerous.</p>

                  <p>But by what event ſoever it happens, that the power of making war is manifeſtly in inferior Magiſtrates, whether ſuch a War may be ſaid to be publick, Lawyers agree not: For ſome affirm it, and ſome deny it: Surely if by publick we underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but what is done by the right of a Magiſtrate, ſuch Wars are publick: And therefore he that in ſuch a caſe ſhall ſet himſelf in oppoſition to the Magiſtrate, incurs the puniſhment due unto thoſe who behave themſelves contumaciouſly againſt ſuch as are ſet over them. But if we take the word Publick in the better fence, for that which is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, as without queſtion it is uſually taken; then are not ſuch wars publick: For to the legitimating of ſuch a War there muſt go, as well the judgment of the Supreme Authority, as other Rites and Ceremonies which the Law of Nations have made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Neither doth it at all ſtagger me that even in ſuch wars, the goods of ſuch as make reſiſtance are lawful prize, and given to encourage the Soldiers; for this doth not ſo peculiarly belong to a ſolemn war, but that the ſame may be done in any other.<note place="margin">No Inferior Magiſtrate can make a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn War, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial warrant.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, It frequently happens that in Empires of large extent, the Lieutenants of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are impowered by their Prince to begin a War; which if ſo, then it is all one as if the Supreme Magiſtrate had immediately done it: <hi>Quod faciendi jus quis alii dat, ejus ipſe auctor cenſetur; Look, What right any man gives to another to do, that he himſelf is reputed the Author of.</hi> But that which admits of a larger diſpute is, Whether in caſe no ſuch power be given, the ſubordinate Magiſtrate by conjecturing at the will of his Prince, may make War. But this I cannot admit of, for it ſufficeth not to foreſee what the will of the Prince would be, in caſe he were conſulted withal; but we are to conſider, what a Prince would have a Magiſtrate to do without adviſing with him, in caſe the matter be important, and will admit of time enough for a ſerious debate, if a general Law were to be made thereupon. For though the reaſon that moves a Princes will, being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſpected, may in ſome particular fact ceaſe; yet the reaſon univerſally taken, ceaſeth not, which is, That all dangers ſhould be timely prevented: which could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, if every inferiour Magiſtrate ſhould aſſume unto himſelf the Right of making War. <hi>On.

For although there were certain Legions of the Gauls in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Army, yet having concluded a League with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whether that injury were to have been revenged on the Gallo-Graecians, was not in the choice of <hi>Cn.

But <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have been contented to have beaten the Germans out of <hi>Gallia,</hi> which was the Province allotted to him, and not have proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the War into <hi>Germany,</hi> without firſt conſulting the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that there was no danger then imminent: The Germans therefore could have no right to demand <hi>Caeſar,</hi> conſidering that they had given the Romans juſt cauſe to make War upon them; but the Romans had juſt cauſe to puniſh <hi>Caeſar</hi> for tranſgreſſing his

Cicero</hi> defends the fact both of <hi>Octavius</hi> and of <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> who upon their own private judgments made war upon <hi>Anthony:</hi> But although it had been as clear as the Sun, that <hi>Anthony</hi> had deſerved it, yet ſhould they have conſulted the Senate and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> before they had begun it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were granted, that the affront given, did manifeſtly deſerve an hoſtile invaſion; yet ought they to have expected the judgment of the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had not been more expedient for the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Though a juſt cauſe of War be given, yet ſhould it be left to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were ſafer at that time to have diſſembled, or to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged it.

Beſides, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Anthony</hi> had been declared an enemy, yet ought the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> to have had their free choice, under whoſe conduct that War ſhould he carried on. Thus the Rhodians anſwered <hi>Caſſius,</hi> demanding <hi>Agdes</hi> of them according to their League, That they were ready to ſend them if the Senate ſhould command them. By this and the like examples (for many ſuch we ſhall meet with) we may learn, not to approve of every thing that Hiſtorians (though of never ſo good fame) ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto us: For ſometimes they are awed by fear, ſometimes byaſſed by affection; ſitting their Stories to their own occaſions: wherefore in ſuch caſes we ſhould endeavour to be guided by our own uncorrupted Judgments, and not raſhly to make thoſe Actions our Precedents, which deſerve rather to be excuſed than applauded; whereby we may be drawn into pernicious errors. Now whereas it hath been ſaid, That a publick War cannot juſtly be undertaken without the Authority of the Supreme Magiſtrate; it will be neceſſary for the better underſtanding as well of this Queſtion, and of that of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn War, as of divers others, to enquire what that Supreme Power is, and in whom it reſts: And the rather, becauſe the Learned of this Age, do not ſo well determine it; for whilſt each of them purſues this Argument, rather according to preſent uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, than according to truth; they have rendred that which, of it ſelf, was not very eaſie, much more dark and obſcure than it was before.</p>

                  <p>That Moral Power whereby Common-wealths are governed, which <hi>Thucydides</hi> calls the Civil Power, he deſcribes by three things; where he calls a City, that is truly ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, 1. That it ſhould have a power to make or aboliſh Laws. 2. That it ſhould have a power to paſs Judgments. And 3. To create Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or which the word will likewiſe bear, to raiſe Taxes; for every Common-wealth ought to have a Moral Power in theſe things.<note place="margin">Pol. l. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> divides the adminiſtration of this power into three parts: The firſt is, The conſultation about things common; as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Peace, War, Leagues to be either made or broken. The ſecond is, The choice of fit Perſons for Magiſtrates. And the third is, A power to determine all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis</hi> makes the Civil Power to conſiſt in theſe three things: 1. The Creation of Magiſtrates, 2. The Legiſlative Power, And 3. The power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding either Peace or War. And elſewhere he adds this fourth, namely, A power to determine all differences, by paſſing definitive Sentences; and by and by he adds, The care of ſetling Religion, and the power of calling Aſſemblies. But he that would right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divide this power, ſo that nothing be either defective or redundant, may do it thus: He that rules in any Common-wealth, doth it partly by himſelf, and partly by others. What he doth by himſelf concerns either Univerſals or Particulars: what concerns Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals, are the making of Laws or the abrogating of them; and theſe are either ſacred (ſo far forth as concerns the Civil State) or prophane. This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the Art of building up a City: Thoſe ſingulars about which this power is converſant, are either things directly Publick, or Private, yet ſuch as are in order to Publick. Thoſe that are directly Publick, are either Actions, as Peace, War, Leagues; or Things, as Taxes, Cuſtoms, Tributes, and ſuch like: Wherein alſo is comprehended that eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, that every Common-wealth hath over the Perſons and Goods of its own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo far as concerns the publick ſafety: And this Art <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms by its general name, Political, that is Civil, or the Art of Counſelling and well Adviſing. Or (as I ſaid) they are things private; namely, things controverted between ſingular perſons, the determination whereof doth much conduce to publick peace and ſafety; and this Art <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms judicial. But thoſe things which he diſpatcheth by another, he doth either by Magiſtrates or by Procurators, among whom we are to place Embaſſadors, and Envoyes. And in theſe things do principally conſiſt the Civil Power.</p>

                  <head>VII. Power Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme what it is?</head>
                  <p>That we call the Supreme Power, whoſe Acts are not ſubject to the power of another, nor can by any Humane Authority be made void; when, I ſay, by another, I exclude him who hath this Supreme Power, in whoſe power it is to change his own Will; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I exclude his Succeſſor who hath the ſame right, and ſo the ſame power and no other. This therefore is that which we call the Supreme Power:<note place="margin">In whom it is.</note> Now let us ſee in whom it reſts, the Subject wherein this Soveraign Power remains, is either common or proper: As the common Subject wherein Sight reſts is the Body, the proper Subject is the Eye; ſo of this Supreme Power, the common Subject is the City or Common-wealth, which, as I ſaid before, is a perfect company or ſociety of men. Hence then we exclude thoſe who have given themſelves up to the power of another people, as thoſe Nations that were conquered by the Romans, were no longer called Kingdoms, but Roman Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For ſuch a people cannot be called a City, in that ſence wherein we now take the word, but the unworthy Members of that City that conquered them, as Servants are the meaneſt Members of a Family. Again, It ſometimes happens, that of divers people there is but one and the ſame head, and yet every one of theſe people do conſtitute one perfect Society; for it is not ſo in the Moral, as it is in the Natural Body, where it is not poſſible that one Head ſhould govern two Bodies: For in the Moral, one and the ſame perſon diverſly conſidered, may be the head of divers and diſtinct Bodies, whereof this is a moſt infallible ſign; for whenſoever the Regal Family of him in whom the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power over divers Nations was united, ſhall be extinct; the power it ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates, and each reverts to its own people. So it may fall out, that many Cities may be linkt in ſo ſtrait a confederacy, that (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſpeaks) they may conſtitute but one well governed Body; and yet doth each of them ſtill retain the ſtate of a perfect City; as is well obſerved both by others, and alſo by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in divers places; ſo then the common Subject wherein this power reſides, is a City ſo underſtood as I have already expreſt. But the proper Subject of this power is either one perſon or many, according to the ſeveral Laws, Cuſtoms, and Manners of every Nation.</p>

                  <head>VIII. Not in the people.</head>
                  <p>And here firſt we muſt diſclaim their opinion, who affirm the Supreme Power to be (every where, and without any exception) in the People; and that ſo fully that it is in their power, either to inforce or to puniſh their King, if he govern amiſs: What great miſchiefs this opinion, being once fixed in the minds of the Rabble, already hath, and hereafter may introduce, there is no wiſe man but may eaſily diſcover.<note place="margin">This proved.</note> For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of which opinion, we offer theſe Arguments to the more ingenious Reader. By all the Laws both of the Hebrews and Romans, it will appear;<note place="margin">Exod. 21.6. <hi>Gell. l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that it is lawful for every man that hath power over himſelf, to bind himſelf as a Servant, or an Apprentice to whom he pleaſeth. And why then ſhould it not be as lawful, for any people natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free, to give themſelves up to any one perſon or Society to be governed wholly by them, without retaining any part of their liberty to themſelves? Neither will it ſuffice to ſay, this is not to be preſumed; for the queſtion is not what in a doubtful caſe is to be preſumed, but what by Right may be done; and it is as vain and frivolous to urge the inconveniences that may ariſe from hence:<note place="margin">No form of Government without ſome Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> For there is no form of Government whatſoever, be it never ſo well fanſied and framed in the Brain, but upon the exerciſe of it will produce ſome inconveniences and ſome dangers with it; ſo that we muſt, do what we can, reſolve to take the advice of the Comedian, <hi>Aut haec cum illis ſunt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda, aut illa cum his mittenda ſunt; either to accept of the inconveniences with the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, or to renounce both;</hi> and ſo live like Beaſts without Government, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inconvenience of all. As there are ſeveral kinds of Trades or Callings for men to live by, ſome better, ſome worſe, and every man is permitted to chuſe which he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; ſo there being ſeveral ſorts of Government, it is in the peoples choice which of them they will be governed by: Neither is the right to Govern to be meaſured by the excellency of the Form, whereof divers men judge diverſly, but by the freedom of their own will: What <hi>Cato</hi> ſometimes ſaid of Laws, may as well be ſaid of Governments; <hi>There are none ſo perfect, but have ſome defects.</hi> But what the ſame <hi>Cato</hi> obſerved is very true, It is ſufficient to commend any Government, that it produceth good effects in the general, and profiteth the greater part of mankind. Now, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">De leg. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>To reckon up all the inconveniences only in any Government, and to paſs over with ſilence all the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is unjuſt, becauſe the good that we ſeek for we cannot obtain, without the evil which we would avoid.</hi> But of theſe ſeveral kinds of Government our choice being made, and the right thereby transferred to another, to reaſſume it at our pleaſure upon what pretence ſoever is unjuſt. Many cauſes there may be for which a people may be induced to renounce, and yield up unto others all right of Government: As namely,<note place="margin">Many reaſons there may be, why a people may yield up themſelves to be Governed by another.</note> when they ſhall be reduced into ſo great danger of their Lives, that no other way can be found whereby to defend themſelves; or when they ſhall be oppreſt with ſo much want, as that they cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſuſtain themſelves. Thus the Iſraelites being diſtreſt by the Ammonites, ſent for <hi>Jephtha,</hi> and rather then be oppreſt by a Foreign enemy, they transferred the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49430:35"/> upon him, whom before they had baniſhed, <hi>Judges</hi> 11. This alſo was the condition of the <hi>Campanes,</hi> when they ſurrendred themſelves unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> in this Form; <hi>We,</hi> ſay their Embaſſadors, <hi>in the name of all the people of</hi> Campania, <hi>do freely ſurrender and give up our ſelves, our City</hi> Capua, <hi>our Fields, Temples, together with all that we have, both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane, into your power, O Conſcript Fathers.</hi> And ſome people we may read of, who have offered themſelves to the <hi>Romans</hi> upon condition of protection only, and have been rejected:<note place="margin">App. Liv. lib. <hi>5.</hi> lib. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> as the <hi>Faliſci,</hi> and the <hi>Samnites.</hi> And if ſo; what then ſhould hinder, but that ſome people may in like manner ſurrender all power and right over themſelves to ſome one man, by whoſe wiſdom and power, they expect protection? Alſo it may ſo happen, that a man having vaſt poſſeſſions, will not admit of any to inhabit his Countrey, but under condition to ſubmit to his Juriſdiction: or, It is poſſible, that a man having large Territories, and a multitude of ſervants, may manumit them, giving to each a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Land, on condition, that they yield him their ſubjection with ſome kind of Tribute. Precedents of this nature we want not; <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That every ſervant hath his ſeveral houſe, and peculiar eſtate, and governs his own Family: his Lord impoſing upon him what proportion of Corn, Cattle and Garments he pleaſeth, which he readily payes, and as a ſervant, hitherto, obeys.</hi> Add hereunto what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved, That ſome men are naturally ſervants;<note place="margin">Some people naturally ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile.</note> that is, ſo apt for ſervitude, as if Nature had made them for no other uſe: and ſo are ſome people too of ſo ſervile a diſpoſition, that they know better how to obey, than how to govern; ſuch were the <hi>Cappadocians,</hi> who told the <hi>Romans</hi> plainly,<note place="margin">Strab. lib. <hi>12.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is under a good King.</note> 
                     <hi>unleſs he could reſtore the Citizens to their ancient Manners: or that he could reduce them to an equality of Civil Rights, and put in force their ancient Laws, when he ſaw ſo many thouſands of men to fight,</hi> Non utrum ſervirent ſed utri, <hi>Not whether they ſhould obey or not, but whom they ſhould obey. Some Cities,</hi> ſaith <hi>Livy, were ſo well pleaſed with the Government of</hi> Eumenes, <hi>that they would not have changed their condition with the Freeſt Cities in the world.</hi> The like is recorded by <hi>Iſocrates, That many deſerted the Free Cities of</hi> Greece, <hi>to live in</hi> Salamina <hi>a City in</hi> Cyprus, <hi>under the Mild Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of</hi> Evagoras. Again, ſuch may be the condition of a City, that there remains no probable hopes of ſafety, unleſs they put themſelves under the Dominion of one ſingle perſon. Such was the ſtate of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which moſt wiſe men thought could not have been preſerved, had not <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> aſſumed to himſelf the ſole Government of the whole Empire. Such caſes, I ſay, not only may, but do uſually happen, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves in the ſecond of his <hi>Offices:</hi> But (as hath been already ſaid) like as private Dominion may by a Juſt War be lawfully acquired, ſo alſo may Civil Dominion, or the right of Empire, if it depend not upon ſome other. Nor would I be thought to ſpeak this of Monarchical Government only, where that is received; but the ſame Arguments will hold for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of an Oligarchical Government, where the Nobles have excluded the Commons, and aſſumed the Government upon themſelves. What, that there is any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſo popular, wherein ſome, as the poor, the ſtranger, women and youths are not excluded from publick Counſels?

Again, ſome Kings there are, that are not ſubject to the whole body of the people, as Hiſtories both Sacred and Prophane do teſtifie. <hi>If thou ſhalt ſay,</hi> ſaith God to the <hi>Iſraelites, I will ſet a King</hi> ſupra me, <hi>above me,</hi> Deut. 17.14.<note place="margin">Deut. 17.14.</note> And unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Shew them the right or manner of the King that ſhall reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.4.

For ſuch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plutarch, have power to govern, not only according to the Laws, but even the Laws themſelves for the publick good.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Flam.</note> Thus <hi>Otanes</hi> in <hi>Herodotus</hi> deſcribes a King, <hi>That he may do even what he will, without being accountable to any.</hi> So doth <hi>Dion Pruſaeenſis, That he may ſo rule, as not to render an account to any. Pauſanias</hi> to the <hi>Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> oppoſeth Kingly Government to that which is lyable to give an account of his Acts to others. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, <hi>That there are ſome Kings who are inveſted with as much power as elſewhere a whole Nation hath over it ſelf, or whatſoever it hath.</hi> So, as ſoon as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Generals began to aſſume unto themſelves Regal power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uno minor Jove, That Kings Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to God alone,</hi> is no leſs Chriſtian, than Ethnick Philoſophy. For in this, and in nothing more, are Kings like unto God, that they depend upon none: He whom God hath placed in his Throne, is accountable to none, but unto him who placed him there. He is <hi>Solutus Legibus,</hi> above the laſh of humane Laws: He judgeth all, but is judged of none. When <hi>Herod</hi> was accuſed to <hi>M. Anthony</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Ariſtobulus, Anthony</hi> makes this Apology for him, <hi>It was neither Juſt nor Equitable, to require an account from Kings for what they do as Kings: For if that were permitted, they could be no longer Kings.</hi> Kingly Power then muſt needs be the higheſt, becauſe there lyes no Appeal from him, or againſt him, but unto God. And as it is ſubject to no other power; ſo it is bounded by no humane Law, as other powers are. 'Tis granted, that <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed ſeems to preſcribe Laws unto Kings, and tells them what they ſhould do, And good Princes will ſay with the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius, Tantum mihi licet, quantum per Leges licet; That only is lawful for me to do, which the Laws account ſo.</hi> But as <hi>Moſes</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us what a King ſhould do, ſo <hi>Samuel</hi> tells us what a King may do: <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us his duty, <hi>Samuel</hi> his power. The Law conſiſts of two diſtinct parts, the one Direct, the other Coercive: the former points at the rationability of the Law; the latter at the danger we run into, if we break the Law. Now Laws ſerve to direct Kings, becauſe they mind them of their duty: But they have no power to force them to that duty, much leſs to Un-King them if they do it not.</note> the people are ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon them all their power and authority over themſelves, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> expounds it.

As for example, A woman being free, may chuſe whom ſhe will for her Husband; but having once choſen, the woman is perpetually bound to obedience: (So he that reſolves to put himſelf as an Apprentice, hath a freedom to chuſe his own Maſter; but having choſen, cannot free himſelf when he pleaſeth.<note place="margin">The wiſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Arg.</note>Another Argument they draw from that maxim of Philoſophers, That all Government is granted for the benefit of the people, and not of the Governors; and therefore the end being more noble than the means, they for whoſe good Rulers are conſtituted, are above the Rulers themſelves. But neither is this univerſally true, That Government is for the good of the perſons governed; for ſome are for the ſole uſe of the Governors, as that of a Maſter over his Servant, is chiefly and principally for the good of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but the good of the Servant is but extrinſecal and adventitious, as the Phyſicians gain is but accidental to the Phyſick he gives. There are alſo ſome Governments that are for the mutual benefit of both parties, as that of an Husband over his Wife: So of Empires, ſome are gained by the Sword, and thoſe doubtleſs are for the benefit of the Conqueror; neither is it therefore to be accounted tyrannical, which word (as now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) implyes ſomewhat of injuſtice: And ſome Empires are for the mutual good, both of him that governs, as of them that are governed; as when <hi>Jephtha</hi> was made King to defend the oppreſſed Gileadites. Yet notwithſtanding I cannot deny, but that in moſt Empires, what was long ſince ſaid by <hi>Heſiod, Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> is very true, That Kings are conſtituted to adminiſter Juſtice to their people. But to infer from thence, that the people are above their King, will be no good conſequence; for the Guardian is appointed for the good of his Pupil, and yet hath he a right and a power over him. But you will farther ſay, That in caſe a Guardian perform not his duty he may be removed, and why then may not a King? Whereunto I anſwer, That the caſe is not the ſame, for a Guardian hath a power above him, by whom he may be judged, but ſo hath not a King; for that there may be certain bounds ſet to all humane power, it is neceſſary that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of one to be Supreme; and That one muſt be either a ſingle Perſon or an Aſſembly, unto whom are referred the laſt Appeals; whoſe faults becauſe they have no Superior upon earth,<note place="margin">Jer. 25.12.</note> God himſelf is ſaid to puniſh: And if he do not, yet is that very toleration intended, either as a puniſhment or as a Tryal of the People.

                  <head>XI. The Second Caution.</head>
                  <p>A Second Caution ſhall be this, It is one thing to enquire concerning the thing, and another to enquire concerning the manner of holding it, which holds good not in things Corporeal only, but in things Incorporeal. For as a Field is a Thing, ſo alſo is a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,<note place="margin">The thing it ſelf diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from the manner of holding it.</note> an Act, or Way. But theſe ſome may have by a full right of propriety, others by a right uſufructuary (as a Farmer hath a right to his Farm,) and ſome others by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Right: As the Roman Dictator the Soveraignty but by a Temporary Right. So Kings, as well thoſe that are firſt Elected, as alſo thoſe that ſucceed to them in a right line, hold their Kingdoms by an Uſufructuary right; (that is, they hold them as to all the rights and profits, but not to alienate them.) But others hold their Kingdoms by a full Right of Propriety, as they that by a juſt War have conquered them: Or he to whom any people, to prevent greater miſchiefs, have yielded themſelves Subjects for protection, ſo as they reſerve nothing unto themſelves. Neither do I agree with thoſe who hold that the Roman Dictator during his time could not have Supream Power, becauſe it was not perpetual. For the Nature of all Moral things are beſt known by their operations: Wherefore thoſe powers that have the ſame effects are to be called by the ſame name. But a Dictator during his time, exerciſeth all Rights that a King doth, who holds his Kingdom by a full right. Neither can any Act of his be made void by any other, as may appear by the Caſe of <hi>Fabius Rutilianus,</hi> whom when the people would have preſerved, they could deal with the Dictator by no other means but by Petition: Whence we may conclude, That he had the ſame ſupreme power. Now the Duration or Continuation of a thing, alters not the nature of it; yet if queſtion be made concerning the dignity which is uſually called, <hi>Majeſty:</hi> doubtleſs, he that hath it perpetuated unto him hath the greater Majeſty, than he that hath it for a time limited only; becauſe the manner of holding it adds much to the Dignity of him that holds it. Now what hath been ſaid of Kings,<note place="margin">Protectors have abſolute power during their time.</note> may alſo be ſaid of ſuch as are, either during the Minority of Kings, or during their Captivity, or Lunacy, appointed Protectors: For neither are thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the people, nor is their power revocable before the time come, appointed by the Laws.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, to ſpeak properly, when any people are ſaid to be alienated,<note place="margin">When a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is not the people, but the right of governing them that is alienated.</note> it is not the men, but the perpetual right of governing themſelves, as they are a people, that is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. As vain and frivolous is that Inference, which concludes, That becauſe Kings conquer Nations by the blood and ſweat of their Citizens, therefore what is ſo conquered, ought of right to belong rather to them than to him: For poſſible it is, That that King may pay his Army out of his own private eſtate; as <hi>M. Anthony</hi> did in his Bohemian Wars, who when the Roman Treaſury was exhauſted, being unwilling to impoſe any more Taxes upon the people, brought into <hi>Trajans</hi> Court, and made ſale of all his Veſſels of Gold, Silver, Cryſtal and Myrrh, together with his own and his wives Robes of Silk and Gold, and all other their Ornaments and Jewels for the maintenance of the War. Or he may pay his Army out of the rents and profits of that patrimony which attends the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And therefore <hi>Ferdinando</hi> claimed to himſelf all that part of the Kingdom of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> which he had gained, with the rents and profits he had raiſed out of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> during the time of his Marriage, as <hi>Mariana</hi> teſtifies.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>28.</hi> Hiſt. Hiſpan.</note> For although a King have but the mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ariſing out of that Patrimony, in the ſame manner as he hath the right of governing the people who have elected him, yet are thoſe profits properly his own. As it is alſo in the Civil Law, where though the Inheritance be judged to be reſtored, yet the profits are not, becauſe they are perceived, not from the inheritance, but from the thing it ſelf. Poſſible therefore it is, that a King may be ſo poſſeſt of the Government over ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his own proper right, that it is in his own power to alienate it. As it was granted to <hi>Baldwin,</hi> by thoſe that accompanied him in his expedition to the Holy Land, That the half of all the Cities, Provinces, Tributes and Prizes that ſhould be taken in that War, ſhould be his. <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">

So we read that <hi>Solomon</hi> gave <hi>Hiram</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> twenty Cities, not of thoſe that belonged to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 19.</note> For <hi>Cabul</hi> (which was the name impoſed on thoſe Cities) was ſeated without the <hi>Hebrew</hi> bounds, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 19.27. But out of thoſe, which the people that were enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi>

                     <hi>the people of</hi> Rome <hi>held his Kingdom as a Province, and not as gained by War or by force of Arms: But

                  <p>The Third obſervation ſhall be this, That an Empire ceaſeth not to be ſupreme, though he that is to govern do by promiſe oblige himſelf either to his Subjects or to God, unto ſuch things as do properly appertain unto his manner of Government.

The Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> did ſolemnly imprecate vengeance on his own head and right hand, in caſe he knowingly failed in what he had promiſed. And the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> ſware, that ye would never puniſh a Senator without a decree of the Senate. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> bound himſelf by oath to obſerve the decrees of the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> And all the Greek Emperours did likewiſe oblige themſelves to obſerve the Canons and Conſtitutions of the Church. But by none of theſe Oaths or Promiſes doth the Power of an Emperour ceaſe to be ſupreme. This may clearly be illuſtrated by comparing the power of a King with that of a Maſter in his own Family: For although a Maſter do promiſe to obſerve ſuch orders as he conceives to be moſt conducing to the welfare of it; yet doth he not thereby ceaſe to be ſupreme in his own Family. Nor doth a husband ceaſe to have power over his wife, though he have obliged himſelf to the contrary by ſome promiſes that he hath made to her: yet I muſt acknowledge that where ſuch Oaths and Promiſes are made, the ſoveraignty is thereby ſomewhat ſtraitened; whether the obligation do only reſtrain the exerciſe of the Act, as that of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, or the very power it ſelf.

It was ſaid by <hi>Agatharchides,</hi> concerning a King of the <hi>Sabae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> That he was not liable to give any account of his Actions as King, and yet if ever he were ſeen out of his own Palace, he might be ſtoned to death juſtly: Which <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo notes out of <hi>Artemidorus.</hi> So that Land which is held upon condition of ſome Truſt to be performed, is held as ſully during the performance of that Truſt, as that which is held abſolutely. But yet it is poſſible that it may be loſt, and ſuch a conditional Law may be added, not only in conferring of a Kingdom, but in any other Contract. For ſome Leagues with our Neighbour Princes we ſee entred into under ſuch penalties. As in caſe a King being at his admiſſion ſworn, ſhall break his Articles of Agreement, his Subjects ſhall not help him, no nor obey him. So <hi>Crommerus</hi> teſtifies in his Treatiſe concerning the affairs of <hi>Poland, Ch.</hi> 19, <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.</p>

                  <p>The Fourth thing is this, That though the Soveraign Power be but one, and of it ſelf indiviſible, conſiſting of thoſe parts above mentioned, adding thereunto Supremacy; that is, the being accountable to none: Yet it may ſo fall out, that ſometime it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, either by Parts which they call <hi>Potential,</hi> or by Parts which they term <hi>Subjective.</hi> As though the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were but one entire thing, yet it ſo ſell out ſometimes that one held the Eaſtern, and another the Weſtern part of it, or that three ſometimes divided the whole between them. So alſo it may fall out, that the People electing a King may reſerve ſome Acts to themſelves, and transfer others to their King to be held in full Right: Which notwithſtanding is not done (as I ſhewed before) whenſoever the King ſhall oblige himſelf by ſome promiſe: But then only when either the Partition is expreſsly made; as in the time of the Emperour <hi>Probus,</hi> when it was agreed, That the Senate ſhould confirm the Princes Laws,<note place="margin">Vid. Gail. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Obſ. <hi>157.</hi>
                     </note> and that they might take cognizance of Appeals, appoint Proconſuls, and give Legates unto the Conſuls: Or when the people, being as yet free, ſhall require it from him whom they chuſe to be their King, by way of a permanent Law or Precept: Or if ſome ſuch thing be added, whereby it may plainly be underſtood, that their King may be compelled or puniſhed if he refuſe.<note place="margin">To command argues a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, but not to compel.</note> For a Precept or Command is commonly from a Superiour, at leaſt in that which is commanded; but to compel, doth not always argue a ſuperiour: For naturally every man hath power to compel his Debtor to do him juſtice, but it is repugnant to the nature of an Inferiour. And therefore from Compulſion there muſt naturally follow at leaſt a parity, and conſequently a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Soveraign Power. Many Allegations are uſually brought againſt this bipar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ſtate. But as we have already ſaid, <hi>In civilibus nihil eſt, quod omni ex parte incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis caret, &amp; Jus, non quod optimum eſt huic, aut illi, videtur, ſed ex voluntate ejus, unde jus oritur, metiendum eſt; In Civil matters it is not poſſible to provide againſt all Inconvenience</hi> (no one Law can exactly fit every mans caſe, no more than any one Shooe can fit every mans Foot) <hi>neither is any thing accounted Right, by ſeeming ſo, to this or that perſon, but by the will of him who was the Law-maker.</hi> An excellent example of this is brought by <hi>Plato</hi> in the third Book of his Laws: For when the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> had built <hi>Argus, Lacedaemon,</hi> and <hi>Meſſena,</hi> they obliged their Kings to govern them according to Laws preſcribed them; which whileſt they did, the people alſo were obliged to continue their Kingdoms unto them and to their poſterity, and not to ſuffer any man to take them from them: And for the better aſſurance of this Agreement, not only the Kings bound themſelves by Oath to their Subjects, and the Subjects to their King; but the Kings bound themſelves each to other, and the people of their reſpective Kings one to another, and the Kings gave their faith to their neighbouring people, and thoſe people to their neighbouring Kings, each King and people promiſing their mutual aid and aſſiſtance in defence of the Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt them. Many examples of this kind may be collected out of the Hiſtories of our Northern Nations, as in <hi>Johannes Magnus</hi> his Hiſtory of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in <hi>Crantzius</hi> of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Pontanus</hi> of the <hi>Danes.</hi>

                  <p>True it is, that ſome Kings will not permit that ſome Acts of theirs ſhall be of force, until they are confirmed by the Senate or ſome other Commiſſioners. Yet he that ſhall hence inferr, That there is a Partition of power, will be miſtaken: For whatſoever Acts are thus reſcinded, ought to be underſtood as though they were made void by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who by this means provides, that nothing fraudulently gained from him ſhall paſs to his diſadvantage.

And <hi>Samuel</hi> deſcribing the Government of Kings ſufficiently proves, That againſt the Injuries done by them, there remained no power at all in the people, either to reſiſt, or revenge.

But this was no reproach unto them, neither was it by compulſion, but by a voluntary ſuſception, as a ſign of their penitence: Nor was it done by any publick Officer; but as he impoſed it upon himſelf freely, ſo he choſe whom he pleaſed to do it; and preſcribed both the manner and meaſure of his own puniſhment.

                     <note place="margin">Colonies.</note> 
                     <hi>But yet they owe a Reverence to their Mother City, and ought to ſend her preſents, as an acknowledgement of the honour they have for her. Livy</hi> concerning that ancient League of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had received all the Rights of <hi>Alba,</hi> and of that which the <hi>Latines</hi> derived from <hi>Alba,</hi> ſaith, <hi>In that League the</hi> Roman <hi>State was ſuperiour. Andronious Rhodius</hi> following <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> did well obſerve, that in contracting amity between Nations of equal power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nic.</hi> 9.18. The weaker ſhould give the greater honour, and the ſtronger the greater ſuccours.</note> 
                     <hi>It was but reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the weaker ſhould give the greater honour, and the ſtronger afford the greater ſuccours. Proculus</hi> in his Anſwer to this Queſtion we very well know, namely, That that is a Free Nation, which is not ſubject to the power of another, although it be comprehended in the League, that that Nation ſhall faithfully uphold the Majeſty of the other. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Nation bound by ſuch a Covenant, do yet remain free, and not ſubject to the power of another. It follows, that that Nation doth yet retain its Soveraignty; the like may be ſaid of a King. For of a free-people, and of a King that is truly ſo, there is the ſame reaſon. <hi>Proculus</hi> adds further, that ſuch a Clauſe is added in the League, to declare, that one Nation is ſuperiour to another; and not to declare that the other is not free. By ſuperiour, we underſtand not in power, (for he had ſaid before, that a free Nation ſhould not be ſubject to the power of another) but in Authority and Dignity: which the words following by a very fit Simile do clearly illuſtrate;<note place="margin">Some Nations are equal in liberty, though not in dignity with others.</note>

But here it may be objected what <hi>Proculus</hi> adds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 16. Four kinds of differences uſually ariſe between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.</note> 
                     <hi>But ſome who belong to our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Cities, are with us found guilty, whom being condemned we may puniſh.</hi> But that we may underſtand theſe words, we muſt know, that there are four kinds of differences that uſually ariſe among Confederates. As in the firſt place, If the Subjects of the King or State under protection, are ſaid to have done any thing againſt the League: Secondly, If the King or States themſelves are accuſed: Thirdly, If the Aſſociates that are under the protection of the ſame King, do quarrel one with another: Laſtly, If Subjects complain of Injuries done them, by thoſe under whoſe Juriſdiction they are.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49430:41"/> If the Controverſies be of the firſt kind, the King or State are obliged either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or to deliver up the Offender to the perſon injured. And this ought to be done, not only between unequal Confederates, but between equals, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch as are not linked together by any League, as ſhall be ſhewed anon. Nay farther, He is obliged to endeavour that ſatisfaction be made to the injured perſon, which in <hi>Rome</hi> was called the Recuperators office: <hi>For the Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aelius Gallus</hi> in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus) doth determine between King and People, Nations and Foreign Cities, how things by the Recuperator may be reſtored, and how they may be received, and how private mens caſes may be proſecuted in each Nation.</hi> For one of the Confederates can have no right directly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or to puniſh the Subjects of the other Confederate; and therefore <hi>Decius Magius,</hi> a <hi>Campane,</hi> being apprehended and bound by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and ſo conveyed to <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and from thence ſent to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> pleaded, that he was bound by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> contrary to the Articles of the League, whereupon he was preſently ſet at liberty. As to the ſecond kind of Controverſies, One of the Kings or People Confederate hath power to compel the other to keep the Articles of the League, and in caſe of refuſal to puniſh him; but neither is this peculiar to a League that is unequal, but may be done in one that is equal: For it is enough to juſtifie any man for ſeeking a revenge againſt him that hath wronged him, that he is not ſubject unto him, as ſhall be proved anon; wherefore this is alſo in force even among ſuch people as are not confederated. The third ſort of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are amongſt ſuch as are equally confederated, and theſe are uſually referred to a Dyet or Convention of the States aſſociated, yet not therein concerned: For ſo the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Latins,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> were wont to do, or otherwiſe referred to Arbiters, or even to the Prince of the League as to a common Arbiter. So in an unequal League it is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agreed, that the things in controverſie ſhall be diſcuſt in that Nation which is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in the League, wherefore neither doth this argue a ſuperiority in power; for even Kings themſelves refuſe not to have their own cauſes ſometimes tryed before ſuch Judges, as even themſelves have conſtituted. But of the laſt kind of Controverſies, Aſſociates have no right at all to judge; and therefore when <hi>Herod</hi> did vehemently accuſe his two Sons before <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> for conſpiring againſt his life, they took it as a favour he had done them:<note place="margin">Joſ.

But here again it may be objected, That in unequal Leagues, he that is ſuperior in the League is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid to command, and he that is inferior to obey; but neither ſhould this move us: for this is when the things in controverſie concern either the common good of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties confederate, or the private profit of him that is ſuperior in that League. As to the things of common concernment,<note place="margin">Dan. 11.22.</note> the Aſſembly not ſitting, He that was the Prince of the League (though it were an equal League) did uſually command his Aſſociates, as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Expedition, did the <hi>Graecian</hi> Princes, and as afterwards the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> did the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and after them the <hi>Athenians. Thucydides</hi> in that Oration made by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>It very well becomes the Prince of the League, in private mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to deal equally; but in publick to be more than ordinarily ſollicitous.

And yet <hi>Dion Pruſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe very <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the times of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at that time loſt their command in the War, they retained only their own liberty.</hi> So thoſe people which <hi>Caeſar</hi> reckoned to be under the command of the <hi>Suevians,</hi> he by and by calls his Confederates. But in ſuch things as appertain to his own particular profit, the requeſt of him that is Superior in the League, are uſually taken for Commands; not that they are ſo indeed, but that they are in reſpect of their uſual effects, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to Commands; for he needs no force, who knows himſelf to be feared. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae ſunt Regum praeces; The Requeſts of Kings have the ſame power as Commands.</hi> And a denyal how juſt ſoever, ſhall be by them as ill digeſted as an injury. <hi>It was never heard of,</hi> ſaith Livy, <hi>before</hi> Caius Poſthumius, <hi>that any Conſul was either chargeable or burdenſome to our Aſſociates in any thing; and therefore were our Magiſtrates ſupplyed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly with Mules, Pavilions, and all other Inſtruments of War, that ſo they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them from our Aſſociates.</hi> In the mean time, it ſometimes ſo falls out,<note place="margin">The weaker Aſſociates ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto ſubjection.</note> That if he that is ſuperior in the League, be much more potent than the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, he may by degrees at length uſurp the Soveraignty over them; eſpecially if the League be perpetual, and that he hath thereby a right to place Garriſons in any of their ſtrong Towns, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſometimes did, when they ſuffered themſelves to be appealed unto from their Aſſociates,<note place="margin">Hal. l. <hi>6.</hi> Livy l. <hi>34.</hi>

                        <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 4.</note> So <hi>Feſtus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> concerning the <hi>Rhodians, At firſt they lived in great freedom, till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> Romans <hi>gently urging them, they were brought by little and little into an habit of Subjection.</hi> So the <hi>Aetolians</hi> likewiſe complained, <hi>That they had nothing left them but the bare ſhadow and empty name of Liberty.</hi> So likewiſe afterwards the <hi>Achaians</hi> complain, <hi>That they had indeed a League in appearance, but were at length brought into a Precarious Servitude.</hi> The like complaint <hi>Civilis Batavus</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> makes againſt the ſame <hi>Romans, That they uſed them not as formerly, like Companions, but uſurped and inſulted over them as mere Slaves.</hi> And in another place, they falſely called that peace, which was indeed but a miſerable Slavery. Thus <hi>Eumenes</hi> alſo in <hi>Livy,</hi> concerning the Confederates of the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that they were their Aſſociates in Name, but their Vaſſals indeed. Thus alſo <hi>Magnetes</hi> in <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trias</hi> was in ſhew free, but in effect all things were done there at the will of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> likewiſe were in appearance free, but indeed under the dominion of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Polybius</hi> teſtifies. Now when theſe things are done, and ſo done as by patient endurance they may by miſtake be ſaid to be rightly done, (whereof we ſhall elſewhere diſcourſe more fully;) then either of Companions they are made Subjects, or certainly there muſt be a partition of the Supremacy, which (as I have ſaid before) may ſometimes happen.</p>

Thus <hi>M.

The Perſonal Obligation is the ſame, whether a man poſſeſſeth the very Right of Soveraignty, or any thing elſe though lying elſewhere, by vertue of the Fief: but ſuch an Obligation as it takes not from a private man the right of Perſonal Liberty; ſo neither doth it diminiſh any thing in a King or State of the Soveraignty, which is Civil Liberty; which is eaſily to be underſtood by thoſe Lands which are called Free-holds, which conſiſt in Perſonal Obligations only, but gives no right in the thing ſo held: for theſe are no other than a ſpecies of that unequal League whereof we have diſcourſed before, wherein the one promiſeth Fealty, and the other ſafeguard or protection. But admit they do ſwear Faith and Allegiance againſt all men, yet would this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nothing from the Right of Soveraignty over their own Subjects. Not at all in this place to mention, that there are ever reſerved in theſe Oaths, a tacite Condition that the War be juſt, whereof we ſhall treat elſewhere. But as to the Right in the thihg ſo held, it may be ſuch, that the very Right of Governing, if held in the right of the Fief or Fee, may be loſt, and ſo return unto him that gave it; as well in caſe the Family be extinct, as alſo for ſome notorious crimes; and yet notwithſtanding in the mean time, it ceaſeth not to be the Supreme Power: For as I ſaid before the thing it ſelf is one thing, and the manner of holding it is another. And by this Right I find many Kings conſtituted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo that the Royal Family failing, the Empire did eſcheat unto themſelves, as <hi>Strabo</hi> obſerves of <hi>Paphligonia</hi> and ſome others.<note place="margin">

                  <head>I. The Queſtion ſtated.</head>
                  <p>PRivate Men may without doubt make war againſt private men, as the Traveller againſt the Thief or Robber; ſo may Soveraign Princes and States againſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes, as <hi>David</hi> againſt the King of the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> Private men may make war againſt Princes, if not their own, as <hi>Abraham</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and his Neighbours; ſo may Soveraign Princes againſt Private Men, whether they be their own Subjects, as <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> and his party; or Strangers, as the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt <hi>Pyrates.</hi> The only doubt is, whether any perſon or perſons, publick or private, can make a lawful war againſt thoſe that are ſet over them, whether as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme or as ſubordinate unto them. And in the firſt place, It is on all hands granted, That they that are commiſſionated by the higheſt powers, may make war againſt their Inferiors; as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did againſt <hi>Tobia</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> by the Authority of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> But whether it be lawful for Subjects to make war againſt thoſe who have the Supreme Power over them, or againſt ſuch as act by and according to their Authority, is the thing in queſtion. It is alſo by all good men acknowledged, That if the Commands of a Prince ſhall manifeſtly contradict either the Law of Nature, or the Divine Precepts, they are not to be obeyed; for the Apoſtles when they urged that Maxim, <hi>Deo magis quam hominibus obediendum, That God is rather to be obeyed than man;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 4.</note> unto ſuch as forbad them to Preach in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> did but appeal to a Principle of right reaſon, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had inſculpt in every mans breaſt, and which <hi>Plato</hi> expreſſeth in almoſt the very ſame words. But yet if either for this, or for any other cauſe, any injury be offered unto us, becauſe it ſo pleaſe him that hath the Soveraign Power, it ought rather to be patiently tolerated, than by force reſiſted: <hi>For although we do not owe an active obedience to ſuch Commands of Princes, yet we do owe a paſſive: though we ought not to violate the laws of God or of Nature, to fulfil the will of the greateſt Monarch; yet ought we rather patiently to ſubmit to whatſoever he ſhall inflict upon us for not obeying, than by reſiſtance to violate our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries peace: The beſt and ſafeſt courſe we can ſteer in ſuch a caſe, is either by Flight to preſerve our ſelves, or reſolvedly to undergo whatſoever ſhall be impoſed on us.</hi>

For in caſe that

                  <p>By the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law, He that behaved himſelf contumaciouſly againſt either the High-Prieſt, or againſt him who was extraordinarily by God ordained to govern his people, was to be put to death; and that which in the eighth Chapter of the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> is ſpoken of the right of Kings, to him that throughly inſpects it, is neither to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of their true and juſt rights, that is, of what they may do juſtly and honeſtly (for the duty of Kings is much otherwiſe deſcribed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.11.) nor is it to be underſtood barely, of what he will do: for then it had ſignified nothing that was ſingular or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,<note place="margin">Joſ. 1.18. 1 Sam. 8.11.

And therefore it is added in that place of <hi>Samuel</hi> before cited, That when the people ſhould at any time be thus oppreſſed by their Kings, as if there were no remedy to be expected from men, they ſhould invoke his help who is the Supream Judge of the whole Earth.

                  <head>IV. By the Goſpel Law.</head>
                  <p>When Chriſt in the New Teſtament commanded, to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, doubtleſs he intended, that his Diſciples ſhould yield as great, if not a greater obedience, as well active as paſſive, unto the higher Power, than what was due from the <hi>Jews</hi> to their Kings: which (St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was beſt able to Interpret his Maſters words) expounding <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. doth at large deſcribe the duty of Subjects;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.2.</note> charging thoſe that reſiſt the power of Kings, with no leſs Crime <hi>than Rebellion againſt Gods Ordinance;</hi> and with a Judgement as great as their ſin. For ſaith he, <hi>They that do ſo reſiſt, ſhall receive unto themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> And a little after, he urgeth the neceſſity of our ſubjection, <hi>Not altogether for fear, but for Conſcience,</hi> as knowing, that <hi>He is the Miniſter of God for our good.</hi> Now if there be a neceſſity of our ſubjection, then there is the ſame neceſſity for our not reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe, he that reſiſts is not ſubject. Neither did the Apoſtle mean ſuch a neceſſity of ſubjection as ariſeth from an apprehenſion of ſome worſe inconvenience that might follow upon our reſiſtance: But ſuch as proceeds from the ſenſe of ſome benefit that we receive by it, whereby we ſtand obliged in duty, not unto man only, but unto God; (ſo <hi>that he that reſiſts the power of the Supream Magiſtrate, incurs a double puniſhment,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plato, Firſt, From God, for breaking that good order which he hath conſtituted amongſt men: and Secondly, From the Common-wealth, whoſe righteous Laws, made for the preſervation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, are by reſiſtance weakned, and the Common-wealth thereby endangered. For canſt thou believe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plato, that any City or Kingdom can long ſtand, when the publick Decrees of the Senate ſhall be wilfully broken, and trampled upon by the over-ſwelling power of ſome private men; who in ſtrugling againſt the execution of the Laws, do as much as in them lyes, diſſolve the Common-wealth, and conſequently bring all into confuſion.</hi> The Apoſtle therefore fortifies this neceſſity of publick ſubjection to Princes with two main Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe God had conſtituted and approved of this Order of Commanding and Obeying; and that not only under the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law: wherefore the Powers that are ſet over us are to be obſerved (not ſervilely, ſuperſtitiouſly or out of fear, but with free, rational and generous Spirits) <hi>tanquam à Diis datae, as being given by the Gods,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plato:</hi> or as St. <hi>Paul) tanquam à Deo ordinatae, as if ordained by God himſelf.</hi> Which order, as it is originally Gods, ſo by giving it a Civil Sanction, it becomes ours alſo; for thereby we add as much authority unto it as we can give. The other reaſon is drawn <hi>ab utili,</hi> from profit: Becauſe this order is conſtituted for our good, and therefore in Conſcience is to be obeyed and not reſiſted. But here ſome men may ſay, That to bear Injuries, is not at all profitable unto us, whereunto ſome men (haply more truly, than appoſitely, to the meaning of the Apoſtle) give this anſwer, That patiently to bear Injuries, conduceth much to our benefit; becauſe it entitles us to a reward far tranſcending our ſufferings, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies. But though this alſo be true, yet is it not (as I conceive) the proper and genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, which doubtleſs have reſpect to that univerſal Good, whereunto this order was at firſt inſtituted, as to its proper end; which was the publick Peace, wherein every particular man, is as much concerned, if not much more than in his private. (For what protection can good Laws give, if Subjects may refuſe to yield their obedience to them; whereas by the conſtant obſervance of good Laws, all eſtates, both publick and private do grow up and flouriſh together.<note place="margin">Plato.</note>) And certainly theſe are the good Fruits that we receive from the Supream Powers, for which in Conſcience we owe them obedience. For no man did ever yet wiſh ill to himſelf. (But he that reſiſts the power of the Magiſtrate, and wilfully violates the Laws eſtabliſhed, doth in effect (as far as in him is) diſſolve his Countreys peace,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> and will in the end bury himſelf alſo in the ruines of it.) Beſides, the Glory of Kings conſiſts in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of their Subjects. When <hi>Sylla</hi> had by his Cruelty, almoſt depopulated,<note place="margin">Plut. Florus. Aug. de Civ. Dei, lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>28.</hi>

And this would at length introduce a general Ataxy, which would be far more perilous than a perfect Slavery. Wherefore ſeeing that God hath eſtabliſhed, and humane reaſon upon tryal, approved of Soveraign Empire, as the beſt preſervative of humane Societies, that every man ſhould yield obedience thereunto, is moſt rational. For without Subjection, there can be no Protection. But here it will be objected, <hi>That the Commands of Princes do not alwayes tend to the publick good,</hi>

                     <hi>and therefore when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from that end for which they were ordained, they ought not to be obeyed.</hi> To which I anſwer, That though the Supream Magiſtrate doth ſometimes, either through Fear, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Luſt, Covetouſneſs, or ſuch like inordinate paſſions, baulk the ordinary path of Juſtice and Equity; yet are theſe, (happening but ſeldome) to be paſſed over as perſonal ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, which (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> rightly obſerves) are abundantly recompenſed by the more frequent example of better Princes. (Beſides, the Lives of Princes are to be conſidered with ſome grains of allowance, in reſpect of thoſe many provocations and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have to offend, which private men have not: All men have their Failings, we our ſelves have ours; and in caſe we will admit of none in Kings, we muſt not rank them amongſt men,<note place="margin">Kings to be cenſured with ſome favour.</note> but Gods. The Moon hath her ſpots, <hi>Venus</hi> her Mole; and if we can find nothing under the Sun without blemiſh, Why ſhould we expect perfection in Kings? He is very uncharitable, that judges of Rulers by ſome few of their Evil deeds, paſſing over many of their Good ones. Seeing therefore, that there is in all mens lives, as in our beſt Coin, an Intermixture of Good and Evil, it is ſufficient to denominate a Prince Good, if his Virtues excel his Errors. Beſides, to charge the Vices of Princes upon the Government, as they uſually do who affect Innovation, is but a cheat: For what is this, but to condemn the Law for the Corruption of ſome Lawyers: Or Agriculture, becauſe ſome Husbandmen do curſe God for a Storm? <hi>Si mentiar, ego mentior, non negotium; If I do lye,</hi> (ſaith the Merchant in St. <hi>Auguſtine) it is I that am to be blamed, not my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> And if ſome Princes do prevaricate in ſome things, they and not their Function are to be blamed.) But as to Laws, though they cannot be ſo made, as to fit every mans Caſe, yet it ſufficeth to denominate them good, if they obviate ſuch diſorders as are frequently practiſed, and ſo do good to the generality of the people. But as to ſuch caſes, which, becauſe they rarely happen, cannot ſo eaſily be provided againſt by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws, even theſe alſo are underſtood to be reſtrained by general Rules. For, though the reaſon of the Law being particularly applyed to that ſpecial Caſe, hold not; yet in the general, under which ſpecial caſes may lawfully be comprehended, it may. And much better is it ſo to do, than to live without Law, or to permit every man to be a Law to himſelf.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> de be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a little before, he commanded ſubjection to every humane ordinance; that is, to the Laws and Conſtitutions of Princes without diſtinction, (for when that Epiſtle was written, there were very few Princes that were not Idolaters,) yet ſubmit we muſt, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for all that, and that <hi>Propter Dominum, For the Lords ſake.</hi> So what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the ſame Chapter being built upon the ſame Foundation, reſpects the duty as well of Subjects as of Servants.

                  <p>Neither did the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians ſwerve from this Law of God, which is an undeniable argument that they ſo underſtood it. For though the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours were ſometimes the very worſt of men, and deadly enemies to the Chriſtian Faith; yea, though there wanted not ſuch under their Government, who under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of freeing the Common-wealth from Tyranny and Oppreſſion, took Arms againſt them, yet could they never perſwade the Chriſtians to joyn with them. In the Conſtitutions of <hi>Clemens</hi> we read, <hi>Regiae poteſtati reſiſtere nefas; To reſiſt the power of a King is Impious.

                  <head>VI. Inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ought not to reſiſt the Supreme.</head>
                  <p>Some very learned men there are even in this age, who accomodating themſelves too ſervilely to the times and places wherein they live, do perſwade themſelves firſt, and then others, That though this Licence of reſiſting the Supreme Power be inconſiſtent with the condition of private men, yet it may agree with the Rights of Inferiour Magiſtrates; nay further, that they ſin in caſe they do it not: which opinion is to be exploded, as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious. For as in Logick there is a Genus which is called Subalterne, which though it be comprehenſive of all that is under it, as a living creature comprehends both man and beaſt; yet hath it a Genus above it, in reſpect whereof it is but a ſpecies: As a living creature is to a body, which comprehends all ſorts of bodies, both animate, and inanimate. The like we may ſay of Magiſtrates, ſome are Supreme, who rule all and are ruled by none; others are ſubordinate, who in reſpect of private men are publick perſons, governing like Princes: But in reſpect of the Supreme Magiſtrate are but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, and are commanded as Subjects. For the power or faculty of Governing as it is derived from the ſupreme power, ſo it is ſubject unto it, and whatſoever is done, by the Inferiour Magiſtrate, contrary to the will of the Supreme is null, and reputed but as a private act, for want of the ſtamp of publick Authority. All order (ſay Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) doth neceſſarily relate to ſomewhat, that is firſt and higheſt, (from whence it takes its riſe, or beginning. Now they that are of this opinion, that Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may reſiſt the Supreme, ſeem to introduce ſuch a ſtate of things, as the Poets fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to have been in Heaven before Majeſty was thought on, when the leſſer Gods deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prerogative of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But this order or Subordination of one to another is not only approved of by common experience, as in every Family the Father is the head, next unto him the Mother, then the Children, and after them the Servants, and ſuch as are under them: So in every Kingdom, <hi>Each power under higher powers are</hi>—And, <hi>All Governours are under Government</hi>—To which purpoſe is that notable ſaying of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49430:45"/> commands than thoſe directly from God; who is ſo far from juſtifying our reſiſtance, that he commands our paſſive obedience: But unto Magiſtrates, as they are deputed by Kings, and as they derive their Authority from them.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjects eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul to the higher Powers, doubtleſs he exempts not Inferiour Magiſtrates. Neither do we find amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (where there were ſo many Kings utterly regardleſs of the Laws both of God and Men) any Inferiour Magiſtrates, among whom ſome without all queſtion there were both Pious and Valiant, that ever arrogated unto themſelves this Right of reſiſting by force the Power of their Kings, without an expreſs command from God, who alone hath an unlimited power and juriſdiction over them. But on the contrary, what duties Inferiour Magiſtrates owe unto their Kings though wicked, <hi>Samuel</hi> will Inſtruct us by his own example, who though he knew that <hi>Saul</hi> had corrupted himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo likewiſe the ſtate of Religion publickly profeſt, did never depend upon any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, but on that of the King and <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> For in that after the King, the Magiſtrates with the people, engaged themſelves to the true worſhip and ſervice of God, it ought to be underſtood, ſo far forth as it ſhould be in the power of every one of them. Nay, the very Images of their Falſe Gods which were publickly erected, (and therefore could not but be ſcandalous to ſuch as were truly Religious) yet were they never demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, ſo far as we can read of, but at the ſpecial command either of the people, when the Government was Popular; or of Kings, when the Government was Kingly. And if the Scriptures do make mention of any violence ſometimes offered unto Kings, it is not to juſtifie the fact, but to ſhew the equity of the Divine Providence in permitting it. And whereas they of the contrary perſwaſion do frequently urge that excellent ſaying of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, who delivering a Sword to a Captain of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Band, ſaid, <hi>Hoc pro me utere, ſi rectè impero; ſi malè, contra me: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe this Sword for me, if I govern well; but if otherwiſe, againſt me.</hi> We muſt know, That <hi>Trajan</hi> (as appears by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Panegyrick) was not willing to aſſume unto himſelf Regal power, but rather to behave himſelf as a good Prince, who was willing to ſubmit to the Judgement of the Senate and people; whoſe decrees he would have that Captain to execute, though it were againſt himſelf. Whoſe example both <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Macrinus</hi> did afterwards follow, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Speeches to this purpoſe are recorded by <hi>Herodian.</hi> The like we read of <hi>M.

And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors pretending the authority of an Ancient Tradition, do rightly Interpret their Laws made againſt the eating of meats forbidden, with this tacite exception; Not that it was not juſt with God to have obliged us even unto death, but that ſome Laws of his are converſant about ſuch matters as it cannot eaſily be believed that they were intended to have been proſecuted with ſo much Rigour as to reduce us to ſuch an extremity, as to dye rather than to diſobey them, which in humane Laws doth yet further proceed. I deny not but that ſome acts of vertue are ſo ſtrictly enjoined, that if we perform them not, we may juſtly be put to death: As for a Sentinel to forſake his ſtation. But neither is this to be raſhly underſtood to be the Will of the Law-giver. Nor do men aſſume ſo much Right over either themſelves or others, unleſs it be when, and ſo far forth, as extreme neceſſity requires it. For all humane Laws are ſo conſtituted, or ſo to be underſtood as that there ſhould be ſome allowance for humane frailty. The right underſtanding of this Law,<note place="margin">☜</note> of reſiſting or not reſiſting the higheſt Powers in caſes of inevitable neceſſity, ſeems much to depend upon the Intention of thoſe who firſt entred into Civil Society, from whom the right of Government is devolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſons Governing: Who had they been demanded,<note place="margin">☜</note> Whether they would have impoſed ſuch a yoke upon all Mankind as death it ſelf, rather than in any caſe by force to repel the Inſolencies of their Superiours; I much queſtion, whether they would have granted it, unleſs it had heen in ſuch a caſe, where ſuch reſiſtance could not be made without
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49430:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> great commotions in the Common-wealth, or the certain deſtruction of many Innocents; for what Charity commends in ſuch a caſe to be done, may, I doubt not, paſs for an humane Law. But ſome may ſay, that this rigid obligation to dye, rather than at any time to reſiſt injuries done by our Superiors, is not impoſed on us by any humane, but by the Divine Law. But we muſt obſerve, That men did not at firſt unite themſelves in Civil Society, by any ſpecial Command from God, but voluntarily out of a ſence they had of their own impotency, to repel force and violence whilſt they lived ſolitarily, and in Families apart; whence the Civil Power takes its riſe: For which cauſe it is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it an humane ordinance, although it be elſewhere called a Divine Ordinance, becauſe this wholeſom conſtitution of men was approved of by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But God in approving an humane Law, may be thought to approve of it as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law,<note place="margin">Barkley Lib. <hi>3.</hi> contra Monarchomach. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> and after an humane manner. <hi>Barkley</hi> (who was the ſtouteſt Champion in defending Kingly Power) doth notwithſtanding thus far allow, That the People or the nobler part of them, have a right to defend themſelves againſt cruel Tyranny, and yet he confeſſeth that the whole body of the people is ſubject unto the King. Now this I ſhall eaſily admit, That the more we deſire to ſecure any thing by Law, the more expreſs and peremptory ſhould that Law be, and the fewer exceptions there ſhould be from it; (for they that have a mind to violate that Law, will preſently ſeek ſhelter, and think themſelves priviledged by thoſe exceptions, though their caſes be far different;) Yet dare I not condemn indifferently either every private man, or every, though leſſer, part of the people, who as their laſt refuge, in caſes of extreme neceſſity, have anciently made uſe of their Arms to defend themſelves, yet with reſpect had to the common good. For <hi>David,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</hi>
                     </note> For whereas ſome ſeek to defend the Wars of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> upon this ground, That <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not a King, but an Uſurper; this I account but frivolous: For in the whole Story of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> we ſhall never find <hi>Antiochus</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of their own party, by any other Title than by that of King; and deſervedly: For the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had long before ſubmitted to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire, in whoſe Right <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſucceeded. And whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Laws forbad a Stranger to be ſet over them, this was to be underſtood by a voluntary Election, and not by an involuntary Compulſion, through the neceſſity of the times. And whereas others ſay, That the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi> did act by the peoples right, to whom belonged the Right of Governing themſelves by their own Laws, neither is this probable: For the <hi>Jews</hi> being firſt conquered by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadonoſor,</hi> were by the right of War ſubject unto him, and afterwards became by the ſame Law, ſubject to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> as Succeſſors to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> whoſe whole Empire did at length devolve upon the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And hence it is, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> are termed <hi>The moſt ſervile of all</hi> the Eaſtern <hi>Nations;</hi> neither did they require any Covenants or Conditions from <hi>Alexander</hi> or his Succeſſors, but yielded themſelves freely- without any limitations or exceptions,<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> a conquered Nation.</note> as before they had done unto <hi>Darius.</hi> And though they were permitted ſometimes to uſe their own rites, and publickly to exerciſe their own Laws, yet was not this due unto them by any Law that was added unto the Empire, but only by a precarious Right, that was indulged unto them by the favour of their Kings. There was nothing then that could juſtifie the <hi>Maccabees</hi> in their taking of Arms, but that invincible Law of extreme neceſſity, which might do it ſo long as they contained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the bounds of ſelf-preſervation, and in imitation of <hi>David,</hi> betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſecret places, in order to their own ſecurity; never offering to make uſe of their Arms unleſs violently aſſaulted.<note place="margin">The Kings Perſon to be ſpared in the defence of our ſelves. 1 Sam. 26.9.</note> In the mean time, Great care is to be taken, that even when we are thus enforced to defend our ſelves in caſes of certain and extreme danger, we ſpare the Perſon of the King; for they that conceive the carriage of <hi>David</hi> towards <hi>Saul,</hi> to proceed not ſo much from the neceſſity of duty, as out of ſome deeper conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are miſtaken.

The Laws</hi> (ſaith <hi>Julian) are very ſevere on the behalf of Princes, for he that is injurious unto them, doth wilfully trample upon the Laws themſelves.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Miſopogoris.</note> Now if we muſt not ſpeak evil of Kings, much leſs muſt we do evil againſt them: <hi>David</hi> repented but for offering violence to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garments, ſo great was the Reverence that he bare to his Perſon, and deſervedly; for ſince their Soveraign Power cannot but expoſe them to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hatred, therefore it is fit, that their ſecurity ſhould eſpecially be provided for. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith Quintilian, <hi>is the fate of ſuch as ſit at the Stern of Government, that they cannot diſcharge their duty faithfully, nor provide for the publick ſafety, without the envy of many.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Laws are ſevere in the defence of Kings.</note> (And for this cauſe are the perſons of Kings guarded with ſuch ſevere Laws, which ſeem, like <hi>Draco</hi>'s, to be wrote in blood,) As may appear by thoſe enacted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the ſecurity of their Tribunes, whereby their perſons became inviolable.

If the Eye obſerve a blow threatning the Head, the Hand, being inſtructed by Nature, interpoſeth it ſelf, as preferring the ſafety of the Head (whereupon all the other members depend) before their own:</hi> Wherefore, as <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> notes,<note place="margin">De Amicitia.</note>

                     <note place="margin">We are to prefer his life before our own.</note> 
                     <hi>if in ſo doing he propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the freeing of his own ſoul, rather than that of another mans body: for as Conſcience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to expreſs his fidelity to his Soveraign; ſo doth right reaſon inſtruct him to prefer the life of his Prince, before the ſafety of his own body.</hi> But here a more difficult queſtion ariſeth; as namely, whether what was lawful for <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whether <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> example and the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

Or whether Chriſt who ſo often enjoyns us, to take up our Croſs, do not require from us a greater meaſure of patience? Surely, where our Superiors threaten us with death upon the account of Religion, our Saviour adviſed ſuch as are not obliged by the neceſſary duties of their calling to reſide in any one place, to flee, but beyond this, nothing. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That Chriſt in ſuffering left us an enſample, who though he knew no ſin, nor had any guile found in his mouth, yet being reviled he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but remitted his cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> Nay he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to give thanks unto God, and to rejoyce when we ſuffer perſecution for our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And we may read how mightily Chriſtian Religion hath grown and been advanced, by this admirable gift of patience, wherefore how injurious to thoſe ancient Chriſtians, (who (living in or near the times of either the Apoſtles themſelves, or men truly Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical) muſt needs be well inſtructed in their Diſcipline, and conſequently walked more exactly according to their rules, yet ſuffered death for their Faith;) how injurious I ſay, to theſe men, are they, who hold that they wanted not a will to reſiſt, but rather a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to defend themſelves at the approach of death? Surely <hi>Tertullian</hi> had never been ſo imprudent, nay impudent, as ſo confidently to have affirmed ſuch an untruth,<note place="margin">So <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                     </note> whereof he knew the Emperor could not be ignorant, when he wrote thus unto him, <hi>If we had a will to take our private revenge, or to act as publick Enemies, could we want either numbers of Men, or ſtores of warlike Proviſions?

How cometh it then to paſs, that we ſuffer death ſo meekly, ſo patiently, but that we are inſtructed by our Religion, that it is much better to be killed than to kill? Cyprian</hi> alſo treading in his Maſters ſteps, openly declares, <hi>That it was from the Principles of their Religion, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being apprehended made no reſiſtance, nor attempted any revenge for injuries unjuſtly done them, though they wanted neither numbers of men, nor other means to have reſiſted: But it was their confidence of ſome Divine Vengeance that would fall upon their Perſecutors, that made them thus patient;</hi>

The <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion,<note place="margin">The <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion.</note> we read, conſiſted of ſix thouſand, ſix hundred, ſixty ſix Soldiers, and all Chriſtians, who when the Emperor <hi>Maximianus</hi> would have compelled the whole Army to ſacrifice to Idols, firſt removed their Station to <hi>Agaunus;</hi> and when, upon freſh orders ſent after them, they refuſed to come, <hi>Maximianus</hi> commanded his Officers to put every tenth man to death, which was eaſily done, no man offering to reſiſt: At which time, <hi>Mauritius</hi> (who had the chief command in that Legion, and from whom the Town <hi>Agaunus</hi> in <hi>Switzerland</hi> was afterwards called St. <hi>Mauritz,</hi> as <hi>Eucherius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> records) thus beſpake his Fellow Soldiers, <hi>How fearful was I leſt any of you under the pretence of defending your ſelves (as was eaſie for men armed as ye are to have done) ſhould have attempted by force to have reſcued from death thoſe bleſſed Martyrs?

We find by thy Commands, that thou reſolveſt either to draw us into Idolatry, or to affright us by putting every tenth man of us to death: Make no farther ſearch after thoſe that are willing to lye concealed; but know that we are all of us Chriſtians; all our Bodies thou haſt indeed under thy power, but our Souls are ſubject only to Chriſt our Redeemer.</hi> Then <hi>Exuperius</hi> being the Standard-bearer to that Legion, thus beſpake them, <hi>Hitherto, Fellow Soldiers, I have carried the Standard before you in this ſecular War, but it is not unto theſe Arms that I now invite you, it is not unto theſe Wars that I am now to excite your valour, for now we are to practiſe another kind of warfare; for with theſe weapons ye can never inforce your way into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And by and by he ſends this meſſage to the Emperor, <hi>Againſt thee, O</hi> Caeſar, <hi>Deſparation it ſelf (which uſually makes even Cowards valiant) cannot prevail with us to take Arms. Behold we have our weapons fixt, yet will we not reſiſt; becauſe we chuſe rather to be killed by thee than to overcome thee, and to dye innocents, than to live Rebels to either God or thee.</hi> And a little after he adds, <hi>Tela projicimus, &amp;c.

Wherefore, as alſo of that Kingdom that is barely uſufructuary, whereunto I have likened ſuch a King, the opinion of the Civilians is to me more probable, That in yielding up his Kingdom to a ſtranger he confers nothing: And whereas it is ſaid that the fruits and profits revert to the Lord of the propriety; It is to be underſtood, after ſuch a time as is prefixed by the Law. Yet notwithſtanding, if a King ſhall really endeavour to deliver up, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Kingdom to another, I doubt not but that in this caſe he may be reſiſted: For Empire is one thing, and the manner of holding that Empire another.

                  <p>Fourthly, as the ſame <hi>Barkley</hi> obſerves, If a King ſhall endeavour, with a mind truly hoſtile, the deſtruction of the whole body of the Nation over which he is ſet to govern, he loſeth his Kingdom and may be reſiſted: Which I grant. For the end of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being for mutual conſervation, he that wilfully reſolves to deſtroy, can have no right to Govern. Wherefore he that openly, either in word or deed, profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an enemy to the whole Nation, is in that very act preſumed to abjure and renounce
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49430:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Government of it. When <hi>Scylla</hi> had depopulated not <hi>Rome</hi> only, but almoſt all <hi>Italy,</hi> one ſeriouſly adviſed him, that it was fit to ſpare ſome, that he might have ſome to govern; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t eſſent quibus Imperaſſent.</hi> But this caſe can hardly be found in any King that is of ſound mind, and that governs one only Nation. But in caſe he govern more than one, it may ſo happen, that in favour to one, he may endeavour to deſtroy the other, that ſo he may plant it with new Colonies.<note place="margin">Plut. vit. lib. Grac.</note> 
                     <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Arguments are very Ingenious, whereby he proves, that a Tribune of the people (being therefore accounted ſacred and Inviolable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is conſecrated by the people to defend them) in caſe he ſhall endeavour to oppreſs them, to diminiſh their power, and to take from them their rights of ſuffrage; doth thereby actually degrade himſelf, in not performing that for which that honour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on him. For to admit (ſaith <hi>Gracchus</hi>) that the Tribunes of the people may in ſome caſes impriſon their Conſul; and yet to deny that the people have a power to take away the Tribunitial power from him that abuſeth it, even againſt thoſe from whom he received it, ſeeing that both the Conſul and the Tribune were by the people created; would be very abſurd. The like we find aſſerted by <hi>Johannes Major,</hi> namely, That a people cannot abdicate their power of deſerting their Prince, in ſuch caſes as tend to their manifeſt deſtruction. Both which may be very well expounded by what hath been herein already delivered.</p>

                  <p>We have hitherto treated of him who hath or had a Right to Govern; now ſomething we muſt ſay of him that Invades or Uſurps the Government, not after he hath either by long poſſeſſion, or by Conſent or Agreement obtained a Right unto it, but ſo long as the cauſe of his unjuſt acquiſition continues. And certainly during the time that he poſſeſſeth the Empire, his Acts may have power to bind: But yet, not as they are his, for Right to command he hath none, but upon this preſumption, That he who of Right ſhould govern, whether King, People or Senate, had rather that his Laws for that time ſhould be binding, than that the people ſhould live altogether without Laws, and without Judgements, which muſt neceſſarily introduce the greateſt diſorder and confuſion. <hi>Cicero</hi> condemns <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Laws as too cruel againſt the children of thoſe that were proſcribed, in making them uncapable of ſuing for Honours; yet he thought fit, that thoſe Laws ſhould be obſerved: Affirming (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us) that the ſtate of the Common-wealth was ſo contained in thoſe Laws, that if they were not kept, the Common-wealth at that time could not have ſubſiſted. <hi>Florus</hi> alſo concerning the Acts of the ſame <hi>Sylla,</hi> ſaith thus, Lepidus <hi>went about to reſcind the Acts of this ſo great a man, and indeed not without cauſe, if at leaſt, he could have done it, without the ruine of the Common-wealth.</hi> And by and by, <hi>It was expedient for the Common-wealth, being then ſick and wounded, to be governed by any Laws whatſoever, rather than to fret and ſcarrifie her Wounds by attempting an untimely Cure.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding at ſuch times, and in ſuch Caſes wherein our obedience is not ſo exquiſitely neceſſary, and yet may help to confirm the Uſurper in his unjuſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; If by our diſobedience we incur no great danger, we muſt not obey.

                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid if before ſuch an Invaſion there were extant any ſuch Law, authorizing any private man to kill him who dares in his preſence commit ſuch or ſuch a fact. As for example, If being but a private man he ſhall go with a guard about him, or if he ſhall attempt a Fort, or kill a Citizen uncondemned, or illegally condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or if any man ſhall preſume to create a Magiſtrate without juſt ſuffrages. Many ſuch Laws we may read of to have been in force among the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> with whom it was alſo thought lawful to kill ſuch Tyrants. Such was that Law of <hi>Solon</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> renewed after his return from <hi>Piraeeus,</hi> againſt ſuch as had aboliſhed Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or that after ſuch abolition had born any office.

And ſuch was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular Law, immediately after the <hi>Decemviral</hi> Government, That no man ſhould dare to create a Magiſtrate without an Appeal; and he that created ſuch, might by the Laws both of God and Man be killed.</p>

                  <p>Now unleſs it be in one of theſe Caſes, I cannot perceive how it ſhould be lawful for any private man by force either to deject, or to deſtroy him that uſurps the Imperial Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Becauſe poſſible it is, that he who hath the true Right had rather prefer the peace and tranquillity of his Subjects, though under the Uſurpers power, than embroil his Countrey in blood, or to vex his Subjects with Civil War, which are the ſad and bloody effects and conſequences that attend the Murther or Expulſion of Kings, eſpecially if his quarrel be eſpouſed, by either a ſtrong Faction at home, or powerful Friends abroad: Or becauſe it is at leaſt doubtful, Whether that King, People, or Senate, in whom the Right of Empire is, are willing that the matter ſhould be brought to ſo deſperate an iſſue. And without the preciſe knowledge of this, all violence of this kind is unjuſt. It is very true, what <hi>Favonius</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, <hi>Pejus eſt Bellum Civile Dominatu Illegitimo;</hi>

                     <hi>An Inteſtine War is more deſtructive than any Tyranny.</hi> For though the Rage of Incenſed Tyrants may produce more Tragical effects upon ſome particular Families,<note place="margin">☜</note> yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of a Civil War ſpreads farther, continues longer, and leaves more dreadful prints behind it, than any Tyranny. <hi>Give me any peace,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero, rather than a Civil War.

                  <p>LET Us now proceed to the Cauſes of War: I mean thoſe that juſtifie a War; for there are others that excite men to War under the notion of Profit, which are ſometimes diſtinct from thoſe which excite upon the account of Juſtice; which as well between themſelves, as from the beginnings of War, (ſuch as was the Hart in the War between <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Aeneas) Polybius</hi> doth accurately diſtinguiſh.<note place="margin">3 <hi>Hiſt.</hi>

So <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſpeaking of his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> ſaith, That two Kings of <hi>Thrace</hi> were thruſt out, and deprived of their Kingdoms through the fraud and villany of a Thief: Whereunto we may likewiſe refer that of St. <hi>Auguſtin, Remotâ Juſtitiâ, quid ſunt Regna niſi magna Latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia; Take away Juſtice, and what are Kingdoms but great Robberies.</hi> With whom accords that of <hi>Lactantius, Inanis gloriae ſpecie capti, ſceleribus ſuis virtutis nomen imponunt, Being blinded with ſelf-love and vain glory, they miſcal all their vices vertues.</hi> Nor was <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> much amiſs, when he ſaid, <hi>What Thieves do in deſert places, the very ſame do ſuch Princes who prefer Opinion before Truth.</hi> Now other juſt cauſes of making war there can be none, but injuries: So St. <hi>Auguſtin, The wrongs done on the one ſide, make the war done on the other ſide juſt.</hi> So alſo ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi> Herald, <hi>I do teſtifie and declare, that ſuch a people are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and have not done us right;</hi> thereby intimating, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> might juſtly make war upon them.</p>

                  <p>On the contrary, It may ſo fall out, That the life of him that endangers ours, is ſo beneficial to others, that he cannot without ſin be killed; and that not only becauſe it is forbidden by Gods Law both in the Old and New Teſtament, which we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where we ſhewed that the Perſon of a King is ſacred, but by the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For the Right of Nature as it ſignifies a Law, doth not only reſpect thoſe things which are agreeable to that which we call Expletive Juſtice, but it comprehends alſo the Acts of Fortitude, Temperance and Prudence, as being in ſome certain circumſtances, not only honeſt and laudable, but ſtrictly due. But unto this that we have ſaid we ſtand obliged by Charity. Neither am I at all ſtartled from this opinion of mine by what <hi>Vaſquius</hi> urgeth, That the Prince that ſhall Inſult over an Innocent perſon, doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ceaſe to be a Prince; than which, nothing can be ſaid leſs true, or more dangerous. For as Right and Property, ſo Soveraignty is not loſt by miſ-government,<note place="margin">Soveraignty not loſt by miſ-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> unleſs ſome Law doth ſo determine it. But by what Law was it ever yet decreed, that Kings ſhould loſe their Soveraignty, by an offence committed againſt a private perſon? Surely there was no ſuch Law ever yet found, nor I believe ever will be: For the condition of Princes would then be very ſlippery, and the Common-wealth ſoon fall into Confuſion. And as to that which <hi>Vaſquius</hi> layes as his ground work,<note place="margin">The errors of <hi>Vaſquius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> whereupon he erects this and many other ſuch dangerous concluſions; as namely, that all Soveraignty was granted, for the benefit of the Subjects, and not of the King; were it univerſally true, yet were it nothing to the purpoſe: For the thing it ſelf doth not then wholly ceaſe, although the benefit or profit thereof doth in ſome part ceaſe. And whereas he adds, That every man wiſheth well to the Common-wealth for his own ſake, and therefore every man ſhould prefer his own ſafety, before that of the Common-wealth, it doth not follow. For although we do wiſh the preſervation of the Common-wealth for our own ſakes, becauſe our own ſafety is included in it; yet do we not wiſh it only for our own ſakes, but for the good of others alſo. For the opinion of thoſe Philoſophers, who hold, that true friendſhip doth ariſe out of ſome Indigency or Inſufficiency, is rejected as falſe and pernicious, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Man, being a creature naturally ſociable, is promptly and of its own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto it. But that I ſhould prefer the common ſafety before mine own, Charity doth ſometimes perſwade, and ſometimes command me. <hi>Plutarch</hi> will tell us,<note place="margin">Vita Pelop.</note>

It is no marvel,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, if Kings and Princes being the Guardians of publick States, be dearer unto us than our own Relations: For if in the Judgement of the Wiſe,</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>Let us now ſee in what ſenſe the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law is to be underſtood, whereunto that old Law of <hi>Solon</hi> was parallel, which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> commemorates againſt <hi>Timocrates,</hi> from whence was taken the Law of the 12. Tables; and that of <hi>Plato</hi> alſo in his Ninth <hi>de Legibus.</hi> All which Laws do agree in this, That they put a great difference between a Night, and a Day-Thief. But concerning the reaſon of this Law there is ſome queſtion; Some are of opinion,<note place="margin">The Day-Thief and the Night-Thief diſtinguiſhed.</note> that the only reaſon of this Law is, becauſe by Night it cannot well be diſcerned, whether he that breaks into an houſe, be a Thief or a Murderer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the worſt, he may be killed as a Murderer. Others place the difference in this, That in the night a Thief cannot be known, and conſequently the Goods ſtoln cannot be recovered, and therefore he may be killed. But in mine opinion, the Law-makers had no regard to either of theſe properly; but rather, that none ought to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49430:53"/> for ſtealing of Goods directly; yet, that in ſome caſes, the Goods ſtoln might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the death of him that ſtole them; namely, when the Goods ſtoln cannot otherwiſe be recovered, but by killing him who is flying away with them. But if I my ſelf in purſuing after my Goods, ſhall be brought into danger of my life, then it may be lawful for me to redeem mine own life out of danger, though with the hazard or loſs of another mans: Neither can it be juſtly objected againſt me, that I brought my ſelf into that danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I propoſed nothing to my ſelf, but either to defend or recover what was mine own, or to take the Thief, which to me is lawful: nor do I injure any in the uſe of lawful means to a lawful end. But the difference between a Nocturnal and a Diurnal Thief conſiſts in this, That in the Night there can hardly be found witneſſes ſufficient to teſtifie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact. Therefore in caſe a Thief be found ſlain, we do eaſily give credit to him,<note place="margin">In the Night Witneſſes cannot prove the Theft.</note> who ſhall confeſs that he ſlew him in his own defence; eſpecially if the ſlain Thief be found with any offenſive weapon by him. For this is by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law required, That the Nocturnal Thief was found digging through an houſe, as ſome have tranſlated the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word; or as others better, with a digging Inſtrument about him; as the moſt Learned of them have expounded that place of <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34. I am the more eaſily guided to this Expoſition by the Law of the Twelve Tables,<note place="margin">A Nocturnal Thief may be killed, if he have any Weapons about him.</note> whereby it is forbidden to kill a Thief that robs by day, with this exception, Unleſs he ſhall defend himſelf with ſome weapon. Now it is to be preſumed, that a Thief that robs by Night, hath weapons about him to defend himſelf. By Weapons the Lawyer <hi>Cajus</hi> underſtands, either Iron, a Club or a Stone: on the contrary, it is the opinion of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian,</hi> That whereas it is provided by the Law, that he that kills a Thief by Night ſhall be indempnified, it ought to be underſtood, in caſe, that in defending his Goods, he could not otherwiſe free himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lf from danger. There is therefore (as I ſaid) a ſtrong preſumption for him that kills a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Thief: But if there were ſufficient witneſſes to prove, that he that killed ſuch a Thief, was in no ſuch danger, then the preſumption would inſtantly ceaſe, and he that ſhould kill the ſaid Thief, ſhould be held guilty of Homicide. It is likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Law of the Twelve Tables, That he that apprehends a Thief, whether by Day or Night, ſhould publiſh it with an Out-cry (as <hi>Cajus</hi> inſtructs us:) that ſo,<note place="margin">A No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>turnal Thief muſt be aſſaulted with an Out-cry.</note> if it might be, both the Magiſtrate and the people may be called in to aſſiſt, and give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the matter of Fact. But becauſe ſuch a Concourſe cannot ſo eaſily be procured in the Night, as in the Day, therefore is more credit given unto him that ſhall affirm, that he killed the Nocturnal Thief in his own defence. Not unlike is that <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law in the caſe of Raviſhment, which if committed in the Field, the perſon raviſhed was to have been believed; but not ſo, if in the City: Becauſe there ſhe both might and ought by her clamour, to have called in the Neighbours to her aſſiſtance. Not that the Caſe of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment is alwayes to be determined by this Rule, as <hi>Philo</hi> well expounds this place:<note place="margin">A Rape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Field, and in the City, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced.</note> For poſſible it is, that ſuch a fact may be committed in a City without clamour, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the mouth: and that in the Field, it may be done with Conſent (as in his Book of Special Laws he affirms). But that this Rule is to guide us in ordinary caſes of Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, moreover admitting the dangers to be equal, yet in the Night, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well deſcry what the dangers are, either for Quality or Quantity, therefore though the dangers may be leſs, yet the terror muſt needs be more. Let this alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that both the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, though they appear ſevere, yet are they uſually addulced by Charity. For they would not willingly puniſh Theft with death; there being ſo great a diſproportion between Life and Goods, unleſs the Injured perſon in ſtriving to recover his Goods, ſhall be brought in jeopardy of his Life. And <hi>Moſes Maimonides</hi> hath left this Charitable Rule for our Guide, whilſt he gives no private man power to take away the life of another, unleſs it be in the defence of that, which being loſt, is irreparable; ſuch as are Life and Chaſtity.</p>

                  <p>It is queſtioned by ſome, Whether the Law, at leaſt the Civil Law, as it hath power of life and death, in ſuch caſes wherein it ſuffers a private perſon to kill a Thief, doth ſo far legitimate the Fact, as to make it altogether blameleſs? But this I cannot grant. For in the firſt place, The Law it ſelf hath not the power of death over all its ſubjects for every offence; but for ſuch Crimes only as deſerve death. And very probable is the opinion of <hi>Scotus,</hi> That it is not lawful to adjudge any man to death, unleſs it be for ſuch Crimes, as the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law puniſhed with death; with this addition only, or for ſuch Crimes, as may be equally emballanced with them. Neither doth the knowledge of the will of God, which alone can ſatisfie the mind, concerning this ſo great and weighty a matter, ſo plainly elſewhere appear, as it doth in that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby the Thief is not adjudged unto death. Beſides, the Law neither ought, nor uſually doth give unto any man a Right to put a Malefactor to death privately, though he deſerve it, unleſs it be for ſome great and horrible Crime. Otherwiſe the Authority of Magiſtrates and Courts of Judicature would ſoon dwindle to nothing. Wherefore when the Law licentiates a man to kill a Thief, it is to be underſtood, that it rather tolerates, than approves of the Fact; and that it acquits him only of the puniſhment, but not that it gives him a Right to do it.</p>

Becauſe, ſay they, There are very few that will be contented with ſuch a meaſure of revenge, as is proportionable to the Injuries they have received. For this very Fear of what is to come, being uncertain cannot juſtifie us, in the defence of Injuries already done. For ſo, the malefactor may juſtifie his reſiſtance of the publick Miniſters of Juſtice, by his fear, that they will inflict a greater puniſhment upon him, than his Crime deſerves. But he that gives juſt cauſe of offence, ought in the firſt place to tender ſuch ſatisfaction, as in the judgement of unbyaſſed men, is equivalent to the wrong done; which if refuſed, then is his defence Juſt.<note place="margin">2 Kings 18.7, 14. &amp;c. 19.</note> Thus did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who for breaking the League which his Anceſtors had made with the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> being threatned with War, confeſt his fault, and promiſed to pay whatſoever the ſaid King ſhould impoſe upon him; which being done, when notwithſtanding he was afterwards Invaded with a powerful Army, truſting to the Juſtice of his Cauſe, he made his defence, and had the Moſt High God for his Protector. <hi>Pontius Samnis</hi> after he had made reſtitution to the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Goods, and delivered up the Authors of the War, pleads thus with them, <hi>We have I hope appeaſed the juſt wrath of Heaven againſt us for our breach of the League, and am confident that the ſame Incenſed Deities, who have conſtrained me to make full reſtitution of whatſoever we have formerly taken away from the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>will alſo plague the</hi> Romans <hi>for deſpiſing the expiation we offer, for the breach of ſo Inſolent a League.</hi> And by and by after, <hi>What more, O ye</hi> Romans, <hi>do I owe to you, or to your League, or to the Gods, that are the Impartial Arbiters of Leagues?

                  <p>Now theſe things being admitted, we ſay, That the Sea, conſidered either Univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or as to its principal parts, cannot be held in propriety by any: This, becauſe granted by ſome, as to private perſons only, but not unto people or nations, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove, firſt, by moral reaſon. For the cauſe that moved men to decline their tenure of Lands in common, doth not at all hold in the Sea, which being ſo vaſt and boundleſs, and Ships and Men thereon imployed, ſo few, muſt needs be abundantly ſufficient to all nations, and for all uſes; whether for Water, Fiſhing, or Navigation. The very ſame may be ſaid of the air, if any ſuch uſe could be made thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the uſe of the Earth under it were not neceſſary; as in the ſport of Hawking, and in the Right of Habitation; both which do receive Laws from him who is the Lord of the Soyl: For as <hi>Pomponius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Tam Soli quam Coeli menſura facienda eſt:</hi> And again <hi>Cajus,</hi> Cujus eſt Solum ejus eſt uſque ad Coelum; <hi>Whoſe is the Soyl, his is all that is above it, even unto Heaven.</hi> The very ſame may be ſaid of Shelves and Quick-ſands, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made to grow, and whereof there can be made no other uſe, but to ballaſt Ships,<note place="margin">The Ocean not bounded.</note> and whereof there is ſuch ſtore, that it cannot poſſibly be exhauſted. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Natural reaſon, why the Sea ſo taken, cannot be held in propriety: becauſe <hi>Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non procedit niſi in re terminata; Nothing can be ſaid to be poſſeſt, that is not bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Thucydides</hi> calls Land unoccupied, Lands unbounded: And <hi>Iſocrates,</hi>

The former is uſually gained at the charge, and for the benefit of the Common-wealth, or of him who hath the Soveraignty over the people: The other by private Lords or Farmers, which is done, rather by aſſignation from the former, than by any free and unlimited occupancy. But in caſe there be any part or parcel of that Countrey or Iſland, (ſo univerſally occupied) that is not yet aſſigned to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is not therefore to be reputed as waſte, but it is ſtill ſuppoſed to be in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the firſt occupants, be they King or People.

                  <p>Secondly, As to Wild Beaſts, Fiſh, and Birds, this is to be obſerved, That he that hath the dominion over the Lands and Waters, may by his Laws interdict others from taking them; or being taken, from carrying them away: And by this Law ſhall ſtrangers alſo be obliged. The reaſon whereof is, That to the Government of the people it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary, That whoſoever ſhall ſojourn among the people, though but for a while, yet as ſoon as he ſhall enter into their dominions, he ſhall render himſelf Conformable to the Laws and Cuſtomes of that people. Neither doth it avail to the contrary, to ſay, That in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law we often read, that by the Laws of Nature and Nations, it is free for any man to hunt ſuch kind of creatures: For this might be, whileſt there was no Civil Law to prohibit it, as indeed there were many other things that were left free and arbitrary, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws in the Infancy of their Common-wealth, which the Laws of other Nations did ſeverely reſtrain.<note place="margin">Though the Civil Law can enjoyn nothing that the Law of Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, yet it may bound that which the Law of Nature leaves Free.</note> But when the Civil Law ſhall otherwiſe decree it, then the very Law of Nature doth require that we ſhould obſerve it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Civil Law can enjoyn nothing that the Law of Nature forbids, nor forbid any thing that it commands; yet notwithſtanding it may limit and circumſcribe that which the Law of Nature leaves free, and forbid that which naturally may be lawful.

                  <p>Let us now examine, Whether in what is properly ours, there may yet remain a Right in Common to others. Which queſtion may by ſome be thought ſtrange, conſidering that Property ſeems to ſwallow up all Right, which was at firſt held in Common. But it is not ſo; for our better underſtanding whereof, we muſt look back to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe who firſt introduced particular dominion: which may be preſumed to be ſuch as did (as little as might be) recede from natural equity. For if even our written Laws oblige us but to a <hi>Quatenus fieri poteſt; To what in natural equity may be done</hi> (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our frequent Appeals from our Statute, and Common Laws, unto our Courts of <hi>Chancery:</hi>) much more may our Cuſtomes admit of ſuch an expoſition, which are not fitted to Words and Syllables. Hence then it follows, that in caſes of extreme neceſſity that ancient Right of uſing every particular mans goods, as if they remained yet in Common, ſtands in force: For as in all humane Laws, ſo in this very Law of Dominion, caſes of abſolute neceſſity are generally excepted. Hence it is, that in Navigation,<note place="margin">In Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> If the Common ſtock of Victuals be ſpent, what every particular man hath is held as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

All which are not Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but expounded by the Civil Law: But this (as <hi>

For even among Divines, it is a received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That in a time of abſolute neceſſity, if a man ſhall take away from another that without which he that takes it cannot live, he doth not commit Theft: Not, as ſome think, becauſe it is to be preſumed, that the right owner by the rule of Charity, is bound to give it to him that ſo wants it; but, that it may be preſumed, that the reducing of things originally Common into private dominion, was to be underſtood with ſome grains of allowance in ſuch Caſes. For if they that firſt divided ſuch things, had been demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What they would to have been done in ſuch a caſe, they would certainly have been

And although both Empire and Dominion are uſually gained by one and the ſame Art, yet are they in themſelves diſtinct: So we find in <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> That the Lands as well in <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> as in <hi>Attica</hi> were divided, yet the Empire remained in one only. And therefore although the Dominion or Property of things do uſually paſs not to Subjects only, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49430:60"/> ſometimes to ſtrangers, yet may the Soveraignty ſtill remain where it was before. <hi>Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> in the Book that he wrote concerning the condition of Lands, tells us, <hi>That the Fields belonging to their own Colonies being inſufficient, they that took the care to aſſign and divide the Land, did apportion to ſuch of their Citizens as came afterwards, ſuch Fields as they had taken out of the Neighbouring Territories;</hi> contenting themſelves with the bare poſſeſſion, <hi>but leaving the Juriſdiction over them unto thoſe whoſe the Territory was.

                  <p>Controverſies do frequently ariſe between neighbouring Nations, whoſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are ſeparated by the Intervention of ſome great River, whether ſo often as that River ſhall change its courſe, the bounds of both Empires do change with it; and whether, what that River, by altering its courſe, takes from the one, doth of right belong to the other: which diſpute cannot be determined, without firſt knowing the nature and the manner of the Tenure. Surveyors tell us, that Lands are of three ſeveral kinds;<note place="margin">Jul. Frontin.</note> ſome are divided and incloſed with artificial Fences: ſome again are aſſigned by meaſure in groſs, as by hundreds of Acres or Furlongs; and others are called <hi>Arcifinia,</hi> becauſe (as <hi>Varro</hi> hath obſerved) Nature hath fenced them with ſuch bounds as are ſufficient to ſecure them from the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an Enemy; as with Mountains, Woods and Rivers. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> ſaith, <hi>We carry away ſuch things as Nature ordained for Boundaries to ſeparate Nations.</hi> And ſuch Lands are alſo called Occupatory, becauſe commonly they are ſuch, as being waſte and deſart, or being gained by the Sword, are held by occupancy. In the two former kinds, although the River do change its courſe, yet is nothing changed of the Territory, but what is gained by the River, is the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupants. But in thoſe that are Arcifinious, that is, which Nature hath thus bounded, the River in altering by little and little its courſe, doth alſo alter the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49430:63"/> Borders of the Territories. And whatſoever the ſaid River ſhall caſt to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part, ſhall be accounted his, to whoſe Territory it is added: becauſe it is very credible, that both people did at the firſt agree, that the midſt of that River ſhould be the Natural Boundary of both Empires. <hi>Tacitus</hi> accounts the Channel of the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſufficient to bound the <hi>German</hi> Empire.

                  <p>What I have hitherto ſaid holds true, in caſe the ſtream do not change its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. For a River as it divides Nations, is not to be underſtood barely as a Current of Waters, but as waters running in ſuch a Channel, and included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch banks. Wherefore though in ſome particular places, it may gain or loſe, on either ſide, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the banks, or the violence of the Stream, and thereby beget ſome ſmall alteration: yet whileſt the whole body of the River retains its wonted form, the River ſeems to be the ſame. But if the whole River do at once change its Channel, then it is another thing. And therefore as when the old Channel is dammed up with banks of earth, above, and the waters thereby turned into a new one, which is dugg purpoſely to receive them, the old ceaſing, it is called a new River: So, if the old Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſhall be forſaken by reaſon that the waters have found out a new paſſage, it is not the ſame River that it was; but the old being loſt, the River is to be accounted new. And as a River, though dried up in a time of extream drought, yet is each Territory bounded with that mediety of the Channel that is next unto it; becauſe it may be ſafely preſumed that it was the will and intention of either people, to be naturally ſeparated by the midſt of that River: And that in caſe the River ſhould dry up, that either of them ſhould hold what they held before, ſo it is likewiſe, if the water ſhall wholly forſake the Channel. When queſtion is made of the bounds of an Empire, thoſe Territories that do reach unto ſome great River, are always reckoned to be Arcifinious, (that is) naturally bounded, becauſe nothing is ſo fit to bound Nations, as that which cannot eaſily be paſſed over; But that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhould be bounded by either Land marks, or by admeaſurement is rarely ſeen; and where they are ſo, it cannot be thought to be done by Original acquiſition, but by conſent.</p>

                  <p>A Notable Queſtion doth here ariſe concerning a long continued poſſeſſion; For ſeeing it is the Civil Law that gives life and being to this Right, (For Time in its own nature hath no effective power: For nothing is done by time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is nothing that is not done in time<note n="†" place="margin">Nihil fit à tempore, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis nihil non fit in tempore.</note>), it can be of no ſorce, as <hi>Vaſquius</hi> obſerves, between two free Nations or Kings, nor between a King and a Free People, no nor between a King and the Subject of another Prince, nor yet between two private Subjects of two ſeveral Kings or people.

But yet in admitting this, one main inconvenience would enſue; namely, that Titles to Kingdoms, and Controverſies concerning their bounds, would never be at an end: which would not only procure much trouble and perturbation of mind among many, and occaſion matter for War, but is repugnant to the common ſenſe of all Nations.</p>

And yet will not the nature of humane ſociety admit, that theſe internal acts of the mind, being ſufficiently expreſt, ſhould have no efficacy; wherefore whatſoever is ſo ſufficiently ſignified, ſhall be held for truth, and be admitted of as a good plea againſt him, that ſhall ſo expreſs his mind, which if done by words, the caſe is plain.</p>

And why this ſhould not take place, as well amongſt Kings and free people, as amongſt private perſons, no reaſon can be aſſigned: The like may be ſaid, when a Prince ſhall give leave, or command his Subject to do that which cannot with ſafety be done, unleſs he be exempted from the penalty of the Law; it may be preſumed that he is ſo exempted, for this ariſeth not from the Civil, but from that natural right which every man hath to renounce what is his own; and from a natural preſumption, whereby every man is believed to will that, which by ſigns he ſufficiently declares.

                  <p>But here it may be ſaid, and haply not improbably, that this depends not upon a bare preſumption, but that it was a Law introduced by the voluntary Right of Nations, that an immemorial and an uninterrupted poſſeſſion without any claim or appeal made to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, ſhould be of force to transfer an undoubted Dominion: And therefore when <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi> was given to the Elders of <hi>Catana</hi> by the <hi>Graecian</hi> Emperors, <hi>Gregoras</hi> tells us, That there was a Law added, that every of their Succeſſors ſhould declare in writing that they held it under the Title of Adminiſtrators, leſt by a long continued omiſſion, the right of the Emperour ſhould be excluded: For it may eaſily be admitted, that what did ſo highly conduce to the publick peace and common benefit of mankind, might by the conſent of all Nations paſs into a Law. But this muſt be underſtood of an uninterrupted poſſeſſion, that is,<note place="margin">

                  <head>X. Whether the Right of thoſe unborn, may be thus loſt.</head>
                  <p>But a more knotty Queſtion yet remains, namely, Whether the right of ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, may by ſuch a dereliction tacitely paſs from them? If we ſay it cannot, then neither can a long uninterrupted poſſeſſion, add any certainty to Dominion or Empire, becauſe there are few of them, but ſome that are unborn may pretend a Title to: If we ſay it may, then will it ſeem as ſtrong, how ſilence can prejudice them that could never ſpeak, as having as yet no exiſtence; or how the fact of one man may damnifie another. To reſolve this, we muſt know,<note place="margin">He that hath no viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can have no right.</note> that he that hath no viſible being, can have no right; as that which hath no exiſtence can have no accidents: wherefore if the people, from whoſe will all right of Soveraignty did originally proceed, may change their will; ſurely they cannot be ſaid to injure thoſe that are as yet unborn, ſeeing they have as yet no acquired right. But as the people may change their will expreſly, ſo may they be believed to do it tacitely; and therefore it being granted, that the people have changed their will, and that the right of thoſe who are as yet unborn, doth not exiſt, but that the Parents of whom they may be born, and who had a right in the mean time to have preſerved it for them did relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it; what ſhould hinder but that what is thus deſerted, may be occupied by another. Many examples we find in Hiſtories of ſuch Derelictions,<note place="margin">Many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictions. <hi>Mariana l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> the moſt eminent is that of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> whom we find renouncing for himſelf and his children, all that right which, by his Mother <hi>Blanch,</hi> he might have claimed to the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile. And thoſe renunciations, which the Infanta's of</hi> Spain <hi>do uſually make, whenſoever they marry to the Kings of</hi> France, <hi>are of force to debar them, and their Children, from all pretenſions to the Crown of</hi> Spain. And thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken of that right which is natural. For by the Civil Law, as many other Fictions, ſo this alſo may be introduced, that the Law may, in the mean time, ſuſtain the perſons of ſuch as are unborn, and may ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that nothing ſhall be poſſeſt by any other, to their prejudice; as the Civil Law doth for the inheritances of Infants and Ideots: But whether the Law will do it or not, is not raſhly to be preſumed, becauſe what thus conduceth to the particular benefit of theſe, may haply much endanger the Common-wealth. There is no doubt, but that ſuch a right may be eſtabliſhed by the Civil Law, as cannot lawfully be alienated by any one act, which, notwithſtanding, for the avoiding of the uncertainty of Dominion, may by the neglect of claim in ſome certain time be loſt, yet ſo, that they that ſhall afterwards be born, may have their perſonal Action againſt thoſe by whoſe neglect they have loſt their Right, or againſt their heirs.</p>

                  <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it is plain; that a juſt Title may be gained by one King againſt another, and by one free people againſt another, not only by expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49430:66"/> but by dereliction and the occupancy following it, creating (as it were) from thence a new Right or Title unto it: For as to that general maxim, <hi>Quae ab initio non valent, ex poſt facto convaleſcere non poſſunt, Thoſe Titles which were originally naught, cannot by any poſt fact be made good,</hi> is to be underſtood with this exception, unleſs ſome new cauſe do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, which, of it ſelf, is apt and able to form a new right: And by this means, that is, by a manifeſt dereliction and a long poſſeſſion, he that is a true King, may loſe his Kingdom and become a Subject to the people, and he that was really no King, but a Prince, may become an abſolute King: And that Soveraign Power which was once wholly in either King or People, may at length come to be divided among them.</p>

                  <head>XII. Whether Kings are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by thoſe Civil Laws of Uſucapion or Preſcription.</head>
                  <p>But here it is not altogether unworthy our pains to enquire, Whether the Law of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capion or Preſcription, having the ſtamp of the Soveraign Power, may bind him alſo that made it; or whether the very rights of Empires, or their neceſſary parts, which we have elſewhere explained, are ſubject to this Law of Preſcription, and uninterrupted poſſeſſion. Some <hi>Civilians</hi> are of opinion that they are, and thoſe not a few, eſpecially of ſuch as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle queſtions concerning Soveraign Empire according to the Civil Law of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But we, with ſome others, are of another opinion;<note place="margin">Kings not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound by their own Laws directly.</note> for that a man ſhould be bound up by Laws, it is required, that in the Law Maker there ſhould be both a power, and a will (at leaſt ſtrongly preſumed) ſo to do. But no man can properly impoſe a Law upon himſelf, as a Superior upon an Inferior; for then the perſon commanding and the perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, would be one and the ſame: And from hence it is, that he that hath power to make a Law, hath alſo a power to change that Law, (and conſequently not only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand according to Law, but to command ſometimes the Laws themſelves for the general good.) And yet a King may ſtand obliged by his own Laws, though not directly,<note place="margin">Though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly they may. <hi>Vide infra Bo.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 20. §. 22. <hi>Sen.

For there is not the ſame reaſon, that the Soveraign Power ſhould be bounded and limited by the Law, as other things are, it being in dignity far above it; (for if we once admit it to be abſolute and ſupreme, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo grant it ſome Priviledges and Prerogatives above and before others.) I never yet found any Civil Law that treated of Preſcriptions, that could with any probability be underſtood to include the higheſt powers: Hence then we may conclude, that neither the time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Civil Law, can ſuffice to acquire a Soveraign Empire, or any of its neceſſary parts, in caſe theſe natural Conjectures, whereof we have here treated, be wanting: Nor is ſuch a ſpace of time required, if within that time ſufficient conjectures of Dereliction ſhall appear. Nor laſtly, doth the Civil Law, which forbids things to be acquired,<note place="margin">No Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ſtrong conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction can lye againſt a King as ſuch. ☜</note> within ſuch a certain time, at all appertain to the things belonging to the Supreme Power: Yet might the people in the firſt Creation of the Empire have expreſt their will, by what means, and in what ſpace of time, the Government by not uſing it ſhould be loſt, which Will ſo expreſt, ought without doubt to have been followed: Nor could it then have been infringed by the King himſelf, though inveſted with Supreme Power, becauſe it appertains not to the Empire it ſelf, but to the manner of holding it, as we have elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it.</p>

                  <p>Hence it is eaſie to diſcern, how far forth we may admit of that which <hi>Vaſquius</hi> and others maintain, namely, that Subjects may at all times endeavour, if they can, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that liberty which belongs to a free people; becauſe what was by force got may by force be regained: And of that which at firſt proceeded from the will, it is lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and to change the will; for both that Empire that was at firſt gained by force, may in time by the tacite conſent of the people, yielding thereunto a willing obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a firm and eſtabliſhed Right: As alſo that will, either at the firſt eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49430:67"/> the Empire, or by a poſtnate fact, might be ſuch as ſhould give ſuch a Right, as ſhould not afterwards depend upon that will.

                  <p>In Children, we muſt diſtinguiſh their three different times: The firſt is that of their Infancy, whilſt they are of unripe judgment, not able to know good from evil, not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh truth from error. The ſecond is, When they grow to ripe judgment, but yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Fathers Family. The third period is this, When they are ſeparate from their Fathers and have Families of their own: During the firſt of theſe, all the actions of the Child ought to be regulated by the Parents; for it is but equal, that he that cannot govern himſelf ſhould be governed by another,<note place="margin">Vide ſupra c. <hi>3. §. 6.</hi>

For it is but reaſonable, that every part ſhould endeavour the welfare of the whole. But in his other actions he hath a moral power to do whatſoever his own judgement ſhall guide him to, provided that in all things he endeavour as far as in him lies, to pleaſe his parents. But becauſe this is a debt ariſing not by vertue of that moral faculty, as thoſe above, but from the duty of piety, reverence, and gratitude; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make void thoſe actions of his that are otherwiſe done, no more than it will ſuffice to avoid any grant or gift, given by the right owner, to ſay, That it was againſt the Rules of Parſimony.</p>

For he is the head of the Wife, as well in Conjugal, as in houſhold affairs: For the Wife is but a

But what Power ſoever it is that is given to the Husband beyond this, as by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Law, the Husband had power to make void all the Vows made by his Wife, and by the Laws of ſome people, he had power to ſell away all his Wives goods: This ariſeth not from the Law of Nature, but from the voluntary Laws of men.

Now that principle which gives life to this and all other humane acts, is that Right which we expounded to be a moral power or faculty to do it, together with a will ſufficiently declared.

But herein they are miſtaken: For all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments do enforce no more than this, That it is agreeable to the duty they owe to their Parents, to crave their conſents: Which we ſhall eaſily grant them, provided that the will of their Parents be not manifeſtly unjuſt. For if Children be to reverence their Parents in all things, ſurely they ought to do it moſt eſpecially in ſuch things wherein the whole Nation is concern'd, as in Marriages. And yet it cannot hence be inferred, That a Son hath not a Moral Right to diſpoſe of himſelf, if they conſent not. For he that marries,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49430:69"/> ought to be of mature age and judgement, and he is to forſake his Fathers houſe, ſo that he is herein exempted from his Fathers domeſtick diſcipline. (<hi>And becomes from thence</hi>

That the <hi>Romans</hi> and ſuch other Nations did make void ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages was not from the Law of Nature, but from the will of their Law-makers. For by the ſame Law, the mother to whom notwithſtanding the children do naturally owe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, could not by her deſcent, make the Marriage void; no, nor the father of a Free-man: And if the Father himſelf be under the power of his own Father, then the conſents of both Father and Grand-father, are required to the Sons Marriage: But to the Marriage of a Daughter, the Grand-fathers conſent alone ſufficeth. Which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences being altogether unknown to the Law of Nature, doth evidently prove, that they ariſe not from the Natural, but from the Civil Laws.</p>

                  <p>Concerning Marriages between ſuch as are nearly allied, or of the ſame blood, many difficult queſtions ariſe, which are often with much zeal and animoſity agitated on both ſides. Becauſe he that ſhall undertake to aſſign certain and natural reaſons, why theſe Marriages (that are by Law or Cuſtome thus forbidden) are unlawful, ſhould experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally find how hard, nay how impoſſible, it is to effect it. That alledged by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his <hi>Roman</hi> Queſtions, by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> by <hi>Philo</hi> in his Special Laws, and by St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. as the contracting of new Friends, and the ſtrengthning our ſelves with new Alliances, ſavours more of Policy than true Piety: Nor are they of that force and energy as to conclude the contrary Acts to be either unlawful or void. Whereunto may be added, That ſome caſes there may be, wherein ſuch prohibited Marriages may be more profitable and politick than others,<note place="margin">The Marriage of kindred ſometimes profitable and politick.</note> as may be collected, not only from that which God himſelf in his Law given to the <hi>Jews</hi> excepts, of raiſing Seed to a deceaſed Brother having no iſſue: But from that alſo of a Virgin left by her Father, as ſole heir of all his eſtate, who by the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Laws, was to be Married to the next of kin, to preſerve the name and Eſtate in their own Tribe and Family; and from many ſuch like caſes which do, or may occur.</p>
                  <p>But yet from this general rule,<note place="margin">Inceſtuous Marriages for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and why.</note> we muſt except the Marriages of Parents with their Children in what degree ſoever, the reaſon whereof is ſufficiently evident. For neither can the Husband, who by the Law of Matrimony, is the head of the Wife, pay that reſpect and reverence, that Nature binds him to give to his Mother, nor the Daughter to her Father: For though ſhe be ſubordinate to her Husband by Matrimonial Right, yet doth her Marriage allow her ſo great a Familiarity with her Husband, as is altogether inconſiſtent with the duty of a Child. <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer was in the right, when having ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49430:70"/> That in contracting Marriages the Law of Nature and Modeſty were chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; he added, That it was againſt modeſty for a man to take his own Daughter to be his Wife. And <hi>Philo</hi> in his Special Laws condemns it as an execrable wickedneſs to pollute the bed of his deceaſed Father, which as a thing Sacred, ought not to be toucht, and without regard to either the age, or the reverence of a Mothers name, to make himſelf both Son and Husband to the ſame Woman, and to make her both Mother and Wife to the ſame Man. Wherefore ſuch Marriages are doubtleſs not illegal only, but void, by reaſon of ſomething that is vicious, which perpetually cleaves to the effects of it. Neither is that Argument of <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Chriſippus,</hi> which is drawn from the practice of Cocks, and ſuch like dumb creatures, ſufficient to prove, that ſuch commixtures are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law of Nature.<note place="margin">That is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful which is repugnant to Humane Nature. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Contr.

Now if we would judiciouſly adapt theſe two cauſes unto thoſe Divine Laws before-mentioned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. it will eaſily appear, That in thoſe that are allied in the right line, either Aſcendent or Deſcendent, (for we do not here mention that of Parents with their Children, which Natural Reaſon without any other Law, teacheth us to abhor) and in thoſe the firſt degree of the oblique line, which becauſe of its immediate deſcent from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtock, is uſually accounted the ſecond degree, by reaſon of that freſh and lively Image of the Parents in the Children; The former of the two cauſes above-mentioned is very forceable, as iſſuing from that which Nature her ſelf doth, if not command, yet at leaſt commend unto us as the more honeſt: Of which kind there are many which afford abundance of matter, for Laws both Divine and Humane. And therefore the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do not preciſely tye themſelves to the degrees of the right line, that are expreſt in the Law, but comprehend under them many degrees, that are not there mentioned by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt parity of reaſon. The names whereof, with them, are theſe, The Mother of his Mother, the Mother of his Mothers Father, his Fathers Mother, the Mother of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Father, the Wife of his Fathers Father, the Wife of his Mothers Father, his Sons Wife, the Wife of his Sons Son, the Wife of his Daughters Son, the Daughter of his

                  <p>But that we may proceed to other marriages, it is to be obſerved, That ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinary Contracts may amount to true and authentick marriages: although they may be deprived of ſome effects peculiar to marriages by the Civil Law, or loſe ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that are natural, by reaſon of ſome impediment ariſing from the Civil Law. As for example, the accompanying of a Bond-man with a Bond-woman, was called by the <hi>Romans, Contubernium,</hi> a Conſociation, and not a marriage; yet it had nothing wanting requiſite to the nature of marriage: And therefore in the Ancient Canons, it is called by the name of Wedlock. So the accompanying of a Free-man with a Bond-woman, is not honoured with the Title of Matrimony, but of Wedlock: which by Imitation, is ſince derived to other perſons that are of unequal Conditions; as that in <hi>Athens</hi> between a Citizen and a Stranger. So <hi>Servius</hi> upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> calls thoſe Baſtards, that are born of obſcure Mothers.

But certainly in the ſtate of Nature, ſuch unequal marriages may be Authentick, if the woman be under the cuſtody and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of her husband, and have plighted her troth unto him. So alſo, under the ſtate of the Evangelical Law, a marriage between two Servants, or between a Free-man and a Servant, is a firm and lawful marriage; much more that between a Citizen and a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a Senator and a Free-woman, if thoſe things which are neceſſarily required by the Divine Chriſtian Law, to the accompliſhment of a marriage be added, namely, an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble joyning together of one man to one woman, although ſome effects properly due by the Civil Law to other marriages,<note place="margin">Concubines.</note> do not attend theſe, or which of their own accord would follow theſe, were they not by ſome Law hindered.

Wherein if we conſider the Law of Nature only, that is, if no Law or Covenant have otherwiſe determined, we ought to diſtinguiſh between ſuch Opinions or Sentences, as are altogether inconſiſtent and differ in the whole, and ſuch as differ only in part, that ſo theſe latter may conjoyn in that wherein they agree, though the former cannot. And therefore where the Queſtion to be argued wraps up many things together, it is to be divided and diſcuſs'd in parts. Thus <hi>Seneca,</hi> when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49430:73"/> man delivers his opinion in a Queſtion, whereunto I conſent in part only, I deſire him to divide that wherein I agree with him from that wherein I diſagree, and I ſhall then joyn with him.<note place="margin">Where the Queſtion is not aſſented unto, it is to be diſputed in parts.</note> As for example, they that adjudge a delinquent to pay twenty pounds, and they that adjudge him to pay but ten pounds, may unite in the ten againſt them that would acquit him. But they that cenſure a Malefactor to death, and they that cenſure him to baniſhment, cannot be reconciled, becauſe death and baniſhment are inconſiſtent; neither can that part that would abſolve him, joyn with thoſe that would baniſh him. For though they both agree that he deſerves not death, yet is not that expreſt in the ſentence, but deducible from it by conſequence:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>8.</hi> Ep. ad Ariſtonem.</note> For he that would baniſh doth not abſolve.

Yet by the latter <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, it was lawful for any Citizen to remove his Habitation, yet not ſo, but that he ſtood ſtill obliged to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch Offices in the City, as ſhould be impoſed on him: Neither were theſe to depart out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, and ſpecial care was taken by the Law it ſelf, that they ſhould pay their Contributions. But ſetting aſide theſe municipal Laws and Conſtitutions, let us diſcuſs this queſtion according to natural Right; and that not of any one part, but of the whole City, though under the Supreme dominion of one Perſon. And ſurely that they cannot recede by Flocks or great Companies, is eaſily collected from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the end, which in moral things is able to create a Right: For if this ſhould be lawful, there might inſtantly follow a diſſolution of that Civil Society. <hi>Zonoras</hi> ſpeaking of King <hi>Lazus,</hi> who revolted from the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> makes it the cauſe of a juſt War between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> General had drawn unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Subjects of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But as touching the departure of ſome particular perſons from a City, it is much otherwiſe: As it is one thing to draw water out of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and another thing to turn the courſe of it. <hi>Every Citizen</hi> (ſaith <hi>Triphonius) is free either to ſtay in, or to depart from his own City.</hi> And <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Baldus,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this Law, <hi>That no man ſhould be enforced to ſtay in a City againſt his will, and this he lays down as the foundation of Liberty, that every Freeman hath abſolute power over himſelf,</hi>

                     <hi>either to remain in it or to recede from it.</hi> And yet herein alſo we are to ſubmit to natural equity, which was the Rule that the <hi>Romans</hi> walked by, in diſſolving private Societies; that it ſhould not be lawful, when the publick was damnified by it: For as <hi>Proculus</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, Always not that which is profitable to ſome one of a Society, is uſually to be obſerved, but what is expedient for the whole. But it is expedient for the whole Society, that in caſe any great publick debt be contracted, no Citizen ſhould forſake the City, unleſs he have firſt paid his proportion of it: Alſo if upon confidence of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Citizens, they have begun a War, but eſpecially if they are in danger to be beſieged, no Citizen ought to forſake the City, till he have firſt provided a Perſon as able as himſelf, to defend the Common-wealth.

If the Parents cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Child but at the Lords charge, the Child is a Slave.</note>But of the children of Captives, which are born of Slaves in their Lords Family, there is yet a more difficult queſtion: For by the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of other Nations, concerning Captives (as we ſhall elſewhere ſhew) as of brute Beaſts, ſo of people of a ſervile condition it holds true, that, <hi>Partus ſequitur Ventrem; As is the Mother, ſo is the Child.</hi> But this notwithſtanding is not altogether congruous to the Law of Nature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the Father of the Child may be ſufficiently known: For ſince even among dumb creatures, as <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves of Doves, <hi>Amor utrique ſobolis aequalis;</hi> Both Parents are equally concerned for their own young, thereby acknowledging their common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them. So alſo had not the Civil Law otherwiſe determined, the Child had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the condition of the Father, no leſs than that of the Mother: <hi>For if the Son</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Viſigothick</hi> Law) <hi>be born and created by both Parents, why ſhould he follow the condition of the Mother only, who without the Father could not beget him?</hi> Among the <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> as alſo in ſome parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> among the <hi>Lombards</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> the children are accounted either bond or free from their Father. <hi>The Laws of</hi> England <hi>judge of the Child, not by the Mother, but by the Father; for the Husband and Wife, being but one perſon in our Law, and the Wife mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Freeman, by the common Law of</hi> England, <hi>the Iſſue is free:</hi> Which Laws, though different from the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law, yet, as <hi>Aquinus</hi> notes, doth not much deviate from the Law of Nature. And why not, ſince among the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their <hi>Menſian</hi> Law, if both the Parents were Aliens, the Child born of them were ſo too, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> tells us. Now let us admit that both the Parents are Slaves, it is worth our pains to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally the Child be ſo or not? And certainly if the Parents have no other means to breed up the Child, but in their Lords family, or at his charge, they have a power to deliver him up to the Lord for a Slave. For although the Child were ingenuous and free-born, yet in ſuch a caſe they have power by the Law to ſell him: And in caſe the Parents were Servants to ſeveral Maſters, then by the Law of Nature the Children were to be divided between their reſpective Lords. But if they had but one Child, then of right it belonged to him whoſe Slave the Father was, the Lord of the Mother being firſt ſatisfied for his half part; and yet of the Children of him that was born in the houſe of his Lord, two parts did accrew to his Lord, and but one to the Lord of the Mother, according to the Edict of <hi>Theodoric,</hi>

For of the inward acts of the mind, we are no competent Judges; neither is it congruous to the nature of humane ſociety: But that there ſhould be alſo a publick delivery of the thing transferred, is required by the Civil Law, which being now received by moſt Nations, is (though improperly) ſaid to be required by the Law of Nations. So in ſome places it is required that every Alienation ſhould be publiſhed, either before the People, or before the Magiſtrate, and that it ſhould be alſo recorded; all which do certainly proceed from the Civil Law. But becauſe every Alienation of a mans Right ought to be done with ſound Judgment, therefore the acts of the Will, that are expreſt by ſome overt ſigns, are to be underſtood the acts of a mind endued with Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>But as to the Alienation of any one part of the whole, it is further requiſite that that part that is to be alienated, conſent thereunto. For they that firſt entred into that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did (as may be preſumed) contract a firm and immortal League among themſelves, for the defence of all thoſe parts which are called Integrants: Whence it follows, that

But this body whereof we now ſpeak, is conſtituted after another manner, namely, by mutual conſent and agreement; and therefore its power over its parts depends wholly upon the will and intention of them who firſt inſtituted that ſociety, who without doubt would never have granted ſuch a power to the whole, as to abſcind from it ſelf any of its parts, and to give them up into the power of another.</p>

                  <p>Now the reaſon why, in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, every part of the ſociety hath more right to defend it ſelf, than the body of that ſociety can have over its parts, is; becauſe that part that is ſo neceſſitated, may uſe that Right which Nature gave it, before that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was inſtituted, which the whole ſociety cannot: Neither let any man ſay, that the Right of Empire is in the whole ſociety, as in its ſubject, and therefore may be alienated by it as things held in propriety may; for the Government is indeed in the whole body as in its adequate Subject, (but not diviſibly in many bodies) as the Soul is in perfect Bodies. But that neceſſity that enforceth us to flee back to the Original Right of Nature for defence, cannot here have place: For under that Right the free uſe of Nature is comprehended, as eating, and detaining what is ours, which are natural, but ſo is not the Right of Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which receiving its authority from humane inſtitution, is from it to receive its bounds.</p>

For ſo the Hiſtories of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> do inform us, that their Kings uſurping this Right, did anciently give away whole Towns and Provinces, to be held by a perpetual right.</p>

                  <head>II. A man may have a Right to that which he takes from another, and when.</head>
                  <p>Propriety or Dominion being introduced, it follows, by the Law of Nature, That things are alienable two ways: Firſt, By commutation; which conſiſts in the making up of that Right which I want, whereby the ballance of Juſtice may be made even: or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By Succeſſion. Now Alienation by way of Commutation or Expletion is when for ſomething that is, or ought to be mine, which I cannot receive in kind, I take from him that detains it or ſomewhat in lieu thereof, that is, ſome other thing of equal value. Thus <hi>Irenaeus</hi> excuſeth the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for robbing the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of their goods,<note place="margin">See <hi>Book.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 7. §. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they might take and keep in compenſation of their labour.</hi> Now that Dominion may be thus transferred, is eaſily proved from the end, which in moral things is the beſt proof. For how otherwiſe can I be ſaid to receive my full Right, unleſs I become the right owner of it? Seeing that it is not the bare detention, but the full power to uſe and diſpoſe of it at my pleaſure, that makes the Scales of Juſtice even. An ancient exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this we have in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> where <hi>Heſionaeus</hi> in lieu of thoſe things which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his Daughter by <hi>Ixion,</hi> but not given, took away his Horſes. For Expletive Juſtice, when it cannot recover what is the ſame, endeavours to get the value of it, which in a moral eſtimation is the ſame. By the Civil Law no man, we know, can do himſelf Right: Nay, if any man ſhall with his own hands take away from another, though but what is his due, it ſhall be imputed unto him as Rapine, and in ſome Countreys, he ſhall loſe his debt. And although the Civil Law did not diectly forbid this, yet from the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of publick Tribunals, it may eaſily be concluded to be unlawful. But where there are not publick Courts to appeal unto (as on the Seas and in Deſarts) there the Law of Nature muſt be our guide. So it ſhould ſometimes, when the Laws ceaſe but for the preſent, that is, if the debt can never be got otherwiſe: As, if the Debtor be ready to fly the Countrey before the Courts can be open; in which caſe the Creditor may lawfully have recourſe to the Law of Nature: Yet ſo, that the Judgement of the Court muſt afterwards be expected, before the Right of Propriety can be aſſured, as in the caſe of Reprizals; as ſhall be ſaid hereafter. But yet, if the Right be certain, and it be alſo morally as certain, That a man cannot by a Judge receive ſatisfaction for want of due proof, the beſt opinion is, That the Law concerning Judgements ceaſeth, and that a man may have recourſe to the ancient Law of Nations.</p>

                  <p>Dominion being once introduced, that which naturally guides the Succeſſion to the eſtate of a perſon dying inteſtate, ſetting aſide the Civil Law, is our conjecture at the Will of the deceaſed. For ſeeing that the force of Dominion is ſuch, that it may be transferred at the will of the right owner, unto another: Therefore in caſe a man dyes poſſeſt of an eſtate, leaving nothing to teſtifie his mind after his death; becauſe it is not credible that he would leave it to him that could next catch it, therefore ſhall it ſucceed to him to whom it is probable he would have left it, had he lived to have declared it. <hi>Defunctorum voluntatem intellexiſſe, pro jure eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny Junior; To have underſtood the Will of the deceaſed, is ſufficient to create a Right.</hi> Now to the dead this favour is indulged, That in caſes that are doubtful, it is preſumed, That every man would do that which is moſt juſt and honeſt; whereof in the firſt place is the payment of his juſt debts, and in the next, that which, though not due, yet is moſt agreeable to our duty: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>what is committed to a mans truſt may be reſtored,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paulus, (the perſon dying Inteſtate that truſted it) to thoſe that ſucceed him, becauſe it may be believed, That his Will was freely to leave the lawful Inheritance unto them.</hi>

Becauſe Children when they are born, bring nothing into the world with them whereby to live; and have probably a longer time to live here than their Parents have. And as honour and obedience is properly due to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and not to Children: So is Suſtentation due rather to Children than to Parents: And thus is <hi>Lucian</hi> to be underſtood, when he tells us, <hi>That it is more agreeable to the dictates of Nature, for Parents to love their Children, than for Children their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> And that alſo of <hi>Ariſtotle, That which begets, is always better affected to the thing begotten, than that which is begotten, can be to the begetter: For that is properly ſaid to be our own, which derives its being from us.</hi> Whence it comes, That without the favour of the Civil Law, the firſt Succeſſion to the goods of the Parents is tranſmitted to their Children; it being preſumed, That next after themſelves, they would that thoſe born of them (as being part of their own body) ſhould be plentifully ſupplied with all things, not only neceſſary for life, but for a more honeſt and comfortable livelihood. <hi>Inſomuch, that were all humane Laws aſleep, yet,</hi> as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer obſerves, <hi>would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, which is as it were a ſilent Law, adjudge the Fathers Inheritance unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and inveſt them in it, as their due, by an undoubted Succeſſion.</hi> But yet, as <hi>Papinianus</hi> notes, <hi>cannot Parents claim the eſtates of their Children, by the ſame Right as Children do the Inheritance of their Parents: For Parents are admitted to their Childrens goods meerly out of Commiſeration; but Children to the eſtate of their Parents by the common vote, that is, both
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49430:78"/> of Nature and of their Parents.

                  <p>Now becauſe it is thus natural and ordinary for Parents to take care of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Education, therefore whileſt they live, there lyes no obligation upon the Grand Parents to give them maintenance: Yet in caſe the Father or the Mother dye, or be otherwiſe diſabled, then it is a duty, which in all equity the Parents of the deceaſed Son or Daughter are obliged unto, to ſee their Nephews or Neeces virtuouſly brought up. And by the ſame reaſon, is the ſame duty incumbent on the Parents of more remote degrees if theſe fail. And from hence ariſeth the Right of the Nephew to inherit the Eſtate, inſtead of a deceaſed Son, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> ſpeaks. Which gave occaſion to that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> ſaying, <hi>Filius etiam in Sepulchro ſuccedit; That the Son ſucceeds, though in his Grave.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Filii filiorum ſunt quaſi filii; The Sons of that dead Son, are reputed Sons.</hi> And as <hi>Modeſtinus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Shall fill up the vacant place of their dead Father.

And that that manner of Right was approved of amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> amongſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doth ſufficiently demonſtrate.

                  <p>And here we may add another exception to this general Rule, that is, If it do not ſufficiently appear that ſuch a Son or Daughter was begotten by him: But yet we know that of ſuch matters of fact there can be no certain knowledge: But of ſuch acts as are publickly done before men, there may be ſome certainty upon the Teſtimony of ſuch as beheld them. In which ſenſe the Mother may be certain that the Child is hers, by thoſe who were preſent at its Birth and Education; but thus certain cannot a Father be. Which <hi>Homer</hi> firſt, and after him <hi>Menander</hi> thus intimates:
<q>
                        <l>Know directly no man can</l>
                        <l>From what ſtock himſelf firſt ſprang.</l>
                     </q> And ſo in another place he thus diſtinguiſheth between the Parents,
<q>
                        <l>Fathers do love their Children, Mothers dote:</l>
                        <l>She knows them hers; but this he takes by rote.</l>
                     </q> Therefore ſome way was thought fit to be found, whereby it might probably appear, who the Father of every Child was: And this was Marriage taken in its Natural terms, that is, for ſuch a cohabitation, as placeth the woman under the cuſtody or ſafeguard of the man. But whether by this, or ſome other way, the true Father of the Child be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49430:78"/> known, or that any man doth own the Child as his; by the Law of Nature, that Child, as well as that born in Marriage ſhall inherit. Neither is this ſtrange, ſeeing that we ſee meer ſtrangers (being adopted for Sons) to ſucceed in the Jnheritance, only by conjecture at the owners will. And the Nephew inſtead of the Father; as old <hi>Jacob</hi> adopted <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> into the number of his Sons, in the ſtead of their Father <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But our Natural Iſſue is differenced from our Legitimate by Law only. So <hi>Euripides,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Baſtards, no leſs than thoſe in Wedlock born,</l>
                        <l>Are ours, although by Laws they're left forlorn.</l>
                     </q> And yet may thoſe alſo be adopted Sons, if the Laws forbid not, as it was anciently permitted among the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the Laws of <hi>Anaſtaſius:</hi> But afterwards in favour to lawful Marriage, there was a more difficult way found, to make Baſtards equal to ſuch as were Legitimate, namely, by the free offer of the Court (when they ſay cauſe) or by the ſubſequent Marriage of the Mother of the Child. Thus did old <hi>Jacob</hi> adopt his Natural Son s, making them equal to his Legitimate, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them equal ſhares in his Inheritance. But the contrary may ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, not only by the prohibition of the Law, but even by agreement, when it is agreed on by both parties before, That they that are to be born by that Wedlock ſhall receive only Aliment, but no part of the Ancient Inheritance. And ſuch a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>Concubinary,</hi> although made with a Free-woman: Such was that of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Keturah,</hi> called therefore his Concubine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.6. whoſe Children, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Agar</hi> his Bond-maid, are ſaid to have received gifts, that is, Legacies; but no part of the Ancient Inheritance. So it was anciently among the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> who gave all to the eldeſt ſon, but nothing to the reſt but ſuſtenance only: And not much better are ſecond Marriages in <hi>Brabant,</hi> where the Children by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Venter, have no Propriety in the Eſtate which the Father held at the death of his former Wife.

(For ſometimes to relieve the wants of a Friend, who hath well deſerved of us, is not only commendable, but neceſſary.) But (that in a caſe ambiguous) it may appear what we ought to believe the will of the Inteſtate was.

Thus <hi>Quintilian</hi> alſo, <hi>Next unto them who claim a Right by the Teſtators Teſtament, are his kindred in caſe he dye Inteſtate and Childleſs: not becauſe the Goods of the deceaſed are in Juſtice due unto them, but becauſe being deſerted, and as it were left without any certain Owner, none can pretend ſo much right to them as they, being the next of kin.</hi> And what hath been ſaid of Goods newly purchaſed by the perſon dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inteſtate, That they naturally deſcend to his neareſt Relation; may as truly be ſaid of ſuch Goods as deſcend unto him from his Father or Grand-father, in caſe neither they, from whom they deſcended, nor any of their children do ſurvive, to whom in point of Gratitude they ſhould return.</p>

                  <head>XI. Diverſity of Laws as touching ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</head>
                  <p>Now though what we have here ſaid, be moſt agreeable to Natural Conjectures, yet are they not by the Law of Nature neceſſary: wherefore, from divers cauſes moving mens wills, ſucceſſions do uſually vary, according to the diverſity of Agreements, Laws or Cuſtoms rationally grounded; ſome whereof will admit of ſubſtitution in ſome degrees; others not. The Ancient <hi>Germans</hi> were altogether ignorant of that kind of ſucceſſion which we call Repreſentative, even among their children; as that the Eldeſt Brothers Son ſhould ſucceed in the room of his deceaſed Father: which Right firſt took place in <hi>France</hi> by an Edict of <hi>Childebert;</hi> and was firſt introduced into thoſe parts beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> by <hi>Otho.</hi> So the Ancient <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Right of ſucceſſion went according to the ſole proximity in blood,<note place="margin">Pontanus <hi>7.</hi> Danicor.</note> and not by ſubſtitution, it being ſo decreed by the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was choſen as Arbiter, to decide that difference. In ſome places regard is had to the firſt Purchaſer; in others, this is neglected. There are ſome Countreys, where the firſt-born carries away the greateſt part of the eſtate, as among the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> but in ſome others, all the Children ſhare alike. In ſome the kindred by the Fathers ſide, only ſucceed; in others, thoſe by the Mothers, have an equal portion. In ſome, regard is had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49430:79"/> to the Sex; in others, none at all. In ſome, the kinsfolks in the next degree only are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; in others, they admit thoſe in degrees more remote. To trace all, would be tedious; neither is it my purpoſe ſo to do. But this we muſt grant, That where the deceaſed hath declared nothing of his Will, it muſt be preſumed, that the Eſtate ſhould paſs, as the Law or Cuſtome of the place doth order it; but not ſo much by the power of the Empire, as by the force of this Conjecture, which alſo takes place againſt thoſe in whom the Supream Power reſides. For it is very probable, that what they by their Laws command, or by their Cuſtoms approve of in their Subjects, the ſame in their own affairs, they hold to be moſt Equitable, ſo as no great damage ariſeth to them by it.</p>

And therefore <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third thought that the ſucceſſion to ſuch a Kingdom might be loſt, if he who was to ſucceed, did not fulfill the laſt Will of the deceaſed. Such peculiar and ſeparate Inheritances, we may ſee in ſome Fee-Farms and Copyholds,<note place="margin">Fee-Farms and Copy-holds why firſt given.</note> (which were originally given for the meliorating of Lands barren and deſart, under ſome ſmall Rent, which were not to return back to the Donor.) The like may be ſeen in the Rights of Patronages and Royalties. Whence it follows, That a Kingdom may belong to him, who if he will, may be heir to the Goods; yet ſo, that if he will, he may alſo enjoy the Kingdom, and not inherit the Goods, nor ſubject himſelf to the charge that attends them. Now the reaſon hereof is, becauſe it is probable, that the Kingdom by the peoples conſent, ſhould be ſetled on the King,<note place="margin">Why the people would have their Kingdoms hereditary.</note> in the beſt manner of Right that could be: Neither did they much regard, whether he would accept of the Inheritance or not, ſince it was not for this, that they made choice of an hereditary order, but that the Title to the Kingdom might be clear; and that their Kings being extracted from a Royal Stem, might attract the more reverence from the people, who were apt from their High Birth and Princely Education, to conceive the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes of their Heroick Vertues; and that the Prince in poſſeſſion, might receive the greater encouragement to be careful of the Kingdom, and with the greater Courage and Magnanimity to defend it; as knowing that he was to leave it to ſuch, as were either in gratitude or love moſt endeared unto him.</p>

                  <head>XXII. Of a Lineal Cognatical ſucceſſion, and what manner of tranſmiſſion of right is therein.</head>
                  <p>But there is another kind of ſucceſſion much uſed in ſome Kingdoms, not hereditary, but as they call it, lineal; wherein is obſerved not that Right which is called Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but a Right to tranſmit the future ſucceſſion, as though it were already conveyed; the Law, namely, out of an hope, (which naturally and of it ſelf worketh nothing) raiſing a certain true Right, namely, ſuch a Right as ariſeth from a Conditional Stipulation, which at preſent gives only an hope, that it will be due; which very hope they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the Children ſpringing from the Loins of the firſt King, but in an order that is certain: ſo that in the firſt place, the Children of the laſt poſſeſſor of the firſt degree, as well of thoſe that live, as of thoſe that are dead are to be admitted, with regard had as well among the living as the dead, to the Sex firſt, and then to the Age. But if this Right deſcend on the deceaſed, then this Right ſhall paſs to ſuch as are deſcended from them: amongſt equals alwayes obſerving the like prerogative of Sex, and then of Age, and the tranſmitting of the Right of the dead upon the living, and of the living upon the dead. And in caſe their children fail, it deſcends unto thoſe who are,<note place="margin">Cognatical ſucceſſion.</note> or if they lived ſhould have been, by the like tranſmiſſion next unto him; the ſame diſtinction of Sex and Age among equalls, being alwayes obſerved in the firſt Line; ſo that no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by reaſon of Sex or Age ſhould be made from one Line to another, ſo long as any remain of the firſt Line, of what Sex or Age ſoever. And conſequently the Daughter of a Son, ſhall be preferred before the Son of a Daughter, and the Daughter of a Brother,<note place="margin">See <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus</hi> in his <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> before the Son of a Siſter; ſo the Son of an elder Brother, before the younger Brother. This is the order of ſucceſſion in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and of <hi>Norway</hi> (as <hi>Pontanus</hi> teſtifies in his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtory): and ſuch is the ſucceſſion in many Dutchies, Counties
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49430:81"/> and Baronies that are held by Homage or Fealty to the chief Lord.<note place="margin">This is the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> As in the Counties of <hi>Artoiſe, Champane, Tolouſe</hi> and <hi>Brittany:</hi> This was the order of ſucceſſion preſcribed unto the Dutchy of <hi>Mantua</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund, Anno</hi> 1432. and by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second in his Kingdoms and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But the proof of this Lineal Succeſſion, though there were no Law or Example to guide us, may be taken from the order that is obſerved in Publick Aſſemblies. For if in that order, regard be had to lineal deſcents, it will be a ſign that the hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the children of the deceaſed, was by Law quickened into a Juſt Right, ſo that it may well paſs from the dead to the living. This is that Lineal Cognatical ſucceſſion, wherein women, and thoſe that are born of them, are not excluded, but only poſt-pon'd in the ſame line. So that recourſe is had unto them, in caſe the Males that are nearer, or that thoſe born from Males in an equal line ſhould fail. The ground whereof, as it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from an hereditary ſucceſſion, is the hopes which the people conceive of them who are neareſt related to the Prince in poſſeſſion, and who have the juſteſt hopes to ſucceed him, that they have Educations anſwerable to their high birth and hopes; ſuch are the Children of thoſe Parents, who had they lived, muſt have ſucceeded.</p>

                  <p>There is likewiſe another lineal ſucceſſion of Males only which is called Agnatical, which differs from the Cognatical, in that it excludes Females, and admits only of Males; which, from the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> takes its riſe, and is therefore called the <hi>French</hi> ſucceſſion.

In both theſe lineal ſucceſſions all are admitted that are any wayes allyed, though in degrees never ſo remote from the laſt poſſeſſor, whilſt they can derive themſelves from the firſt King. And in ſome places where the Agnatical Succeſſion is deficient, recourſe is had to the Cognatical.

                  <p>And in the firſt place, this Queſtion ariſeth, Whether a Father may exheredate his Son, ſo that he ſhall not ſucceed in his Kingdom? Where we muſt diſtinguiſh between Patrimonial Kingdoms which are Alienable, and ſuch as are not Alienable. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer there is no doubt, but that exheredation is lawful; for ſuch Kingdoms differ nothing from other Goods: and therefore in ſuch places, where by Law or Cuſtome Exhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redation is in force, it is practicable even in the caſe of Kingdoms: yea, though there were no Law or Cuſtome to warrant it, yet naturally it is lawful for a Father to exclude his Son from all but bare Alimony; yea, and from that alſo, if he have committed any Crime worthy of death,<note place="margin">He may, if the Kingdom be Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</note> or have been otherwiſe notoriouſly wicked, and have of his own whereby otherwiſe to ſubſiſt.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49430:81"/> donation from God himſelf. Now where the Kingdom is Patrimonial, the King may nominate which of his Sons he will to ſucceed him, as the Kings of <hi>Mexico</hi> now do. Nay, if the eldeſt Son have provoked his Father by any hainous crime, and there be no manifeſt ſign that he hath forgiven him, he ſhall be as one tacitely exheredated.<note place="margin">Otherwiſe in Kingdoms nor alienable.</note> But it is otherwiſe in Kingdoms not alienable, though they be hereditary, becauſe the people are beſt pleaſed that the Kingdom ſhall deſcend in an hereditary way, eſpecially from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate. Much leſs ſhall it be in the power of a Father to exheredate his Son where the Kingdom is to paſs in a lineal deſcent: For there without any imitation of an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, it was agreed in its firſt Inſtitution, That the Kingdom ſhould by the peoples gift paſs to every perſon of the Royal Family, in ſuch order as was then preſcrib'd.</p>

                  <p>Another Queſtion is this, Whether a King may ſo abdicate his Kingdom as to deprive his Son of his Right to ſucceed, which is reſolved by the ſame diſtinction. For in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms meerly hereditary, he that renounceth his Kingdom, cannot transfer it to his Son. But in lineal deſcents the Fathers act cannot null his Sons Right that is born: For as ſoon as the children begin to exiſt, the law makes proviſion for them; yea, and for thoſe that are to be born ſo, becauſe that right which, by the peoples conſent is entailed upon them, muſt in due time deſcend upon them. Neither doth that which I have already ſaid concerning tranſmiſſion, contradict this. For that tranſmiſſion is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> as to the Parents, and not Voluntary. But yet a difference there is between thoſe Children that are born before the Renunciation, and thoſe born after: For they that are already born, have by the Law a full Right to the Kingdom, though they that are not permitted to enjoy that Right during the life of their Parent; but to thoſe not born, there cannot as yet be any Right acquired: and therefore it may be taken away by the will of the people, if the Parents alſo to whom it belongs to transfer that Right unto them, be willing to releaſe it. And to this purpoſe is that we have already ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning dereliction.</p>

                  <p>Another Queſtion doth ſometimes ariſe, namely, who ſhall be judge of the Right of Succeſſion to a Kingdom: Whethet the King then reigning, or the people by themſelves, or by ſuch Judges as they ſhall appoint. If the Queſtion be put of ſuch a Judgement as is Authoritative, neither of them have any Right to judge. For Juriſdiction there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but in a ſuperiour, who ſhould have reſpect not barely to the perſon, but to the matter alſo, which is to be poiſed with its due circumſtances. But the caſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is not properly under the juriſdiction of the preſent King: becauſe he cannot of himſelf by any Law bind his Succeſſor. For the Succeſſion to the Empire lies not under the juriſdiction of the Empire, but remains in the ſtate of Nature, wherein there was no juriſdiction at all. But yet notwithſtanding, if the Right of Succeſſion be controverted, the pretenders unto it will do very piouſly and juſtly, if they can agree between themſelves upon ſome indifferent perſons, to whoſe arbitrement they can be contented to refer themſelves; whereof we ſhall diſcourſe hereafter. But the people have transferred all their Juriſdiction from themſelves into the King and the Royal Family; during which, they cannot challenge to themſelves any reliques of it. This I mean of a true Kingdom, and not of every Principality. But yet, if in the diſcuſſing of this Right any queſtion do ariſe concerning the primary will and intention of the people at the firſt inſtitution of the Kingdom, it were not amiſs to take the advice of the people in preſent, that is, of all the three States; I mean, of the Nobles, Clergy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament aſſembled, as is uſual in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi> teſtifies in his Hiſtory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>

                  <p>But let us proceed to other caſes, It hath been often controverted which of the two Sons hath the beſt Right to the Succeſſion: He that was born before the Father gained the Kingdom, or he that was born after: Whereunto the moſt Rational Anſwer is, That he that was firſt born, ſhall firſt ſucceed, if the Kingdom be indiviſible, which holds true in every kind of Succeſſion. (Yet did <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, youngeſt Brother to <hi>Rufus,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whileſt his elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> was in the Holy Land, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pretence, That he was born to his Father after he was Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> whereas his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> was born whileſt his Father was Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> only; yet was <hi>Henry</hi> juſtly branded as an Uſurper of his Brothers Right, by <hi>Mat.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49430:82"/> Now if he that of a diviſible Eſtate may have his ſhare; and in that which is indiviſible, is preferred by the priviledge of his birth: Surely even the Inheritance muſt follow that Son which was born before his Fathers firſt Inveſtiture. But even in a Lineal Succeſſion, a Kingdom is no ſooner got, but the Children which are antenate, do immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hopes of Succeſſion. For admit that there are none born after, ſurely no man will ſay, That thoſe before born are to be excluded. But in this kind of Succeſſion <hi>an hope once conceived begets a Right:</hi> Neither doth it by any poſt fact determine, unleſs it be in a Cognatical Succeſſion, where it may be for a while ſuſpended, by reaſon of the priviledge of Sex.

                  <p>It is no leſs diſputed both by Wars and ſingle Combats, whether the elder brothers Son, his Father being dead, ſhould ſucceed before the ſecond Brother. But this in a lineal deſcent will hardly admit of a diſpute. For herein are the dead reckoned as living, in that they are able to transfer a Right to their Children; therefore the Son of the deceaſed, ſhall doubtleſs in ſuch a Succeſſion be preferred, without any exception made to his age; yea, and where the Succeſſion is cognatical, the Daughter of the eldeſt Brother ſhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Uncle: becauſe in ſuch Succeſſions neither Sex nor Age ſhould make us to decline the right line. But in ſuch Kingdoms as are hereditary, yet diviſible, there ſhall each have a ſhare, unleſs it be where the Right of Repreſentation is not as yet received: as of old among many of the <hi>German</hi> Princes: For it is but of late that Nephews have been admitted before their Uncles. But where it once comes into debate, ſurely the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews caſe is to be preferr'd, as being moſt pleaſing to humane Nature. And where by the Civil Laws of any Nation, repreſentative Succeſſion is once openly admitted, there the Son of the deceaſed Brother ſhall ſucceed in the room of his Father; though in that Law the word <hi>Proximus,</hi> that is, <hi>Next of kin,</hi> be only mentioned. The Reaſons that are extracted out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws for this, are but weak; as is evident to ſuch as inſpect them. But this is the beſt reaſon, That in matters that are to be favourably underſtood, the ſenſe of words muſt be extended to all propriety, not only vulgar, but artificial. So that under the name of <hi>Sons,</hi> may be comprehended thoſe of Adoption; and under the word <hi>Dead,</hi> may in included thoſe that are dead in Law, becauſe the Laws do uſually ſpeak thus. And thus he may deſervedly be ſaid to be <hi>Proximus,</hi> whom the Laws preſent in the next degree. But yet in Kingdoms that are hereditary, and withal individual, and where this Repreſentative Succeſſion is not excluded: Neither is the Nephew always preferred to the Succeſſion, nor always the ſecond Son, but as amongſt equals; becauſe by an effect of Right, as to degrees that are adequate, his caſe is beſt that is eldeſt.<note place="margin">Diod. l. <hi>6.</hi>

                  <p>By the ſame diſtinction we may reſolve another doubt, between the ſurviving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the laſt King, and the Son of the elder Brother: But that we muſt know, that in many places, where among children, the living may ſucceed in the room of the dead in the right line, they are not permitted ſo to do in the tranſverſe. But where the Right is not clear and undoubted, it is moſt rational to incline to that part which favours the Child in the Right of his Father; becauſe we are thereunto guided by natural equity, namely, in that Eſtate which deſcended from his Anceſtors.

                  <p>The Son of the deceaſed Brother, or even his Daughter, he ſaith is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings Uncle: This is true, not in a Lineal Succeſſion only, but even in an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, in ſuch Kingdoms where Repreſentative Succeſſion takes place; but not in ſuch Kingdoms which in expreſs terms do bind us up to the degrees that are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

Neither do we approve of the Reaſon alledged, namely, becauſe the Father of the one, was to be preferred before the Mother of the other: For that was by reaſon of his dignity, which was meerly perſonal, and deſcended no farther.

                  <p>That which he adds, as ſeeming to him moſt probable, namely, That the Neece from the elder Son excludes the younger Son; cannot hold in hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, although Repreſentative Succeſſion be there in force.

                  <head>I. That many things are ſaid to belong to the Law of Nature that properly do not.</head>
                  <p>NOw our Method leads us to treat of that Dominion, which is vulgarly ſaid to be acquired by the Law of Nations, which being diſtinct from that gained by the Law of Nature, we have therefore termed the voluntary Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such is that Dominion which is got by the Right of War: But of this we ſhall diſcourſe better hereafter, where the effects of War: ſhall be explained. The <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers, where they treat of the gaining of the Dominion of things, do reckon up many ways whereby it may be acquired, which they ſeem to juſtifie by the Law of Nations. But to him that diligently examines them, there is hardly any, except that gained by War, that will appear to be gained by that Law of Nations whereof we now ſpeak. But are either ſuch as are to be referred to the Law of Nature, not that which is meerly ſo, yet to that which follows cloſe upon it, Dominion, being firſt introduced, and ſo antecedes all Civil Law; or they are ſuch as may be referred to the very Civil Law, not that of the ſole people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of many other Nations: Which I rather believe, becauſe this Civil Law or Cuſtome came originally from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, as <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis</hi> obſerves, with ſome others, all <hi>Italy</hi> and ſome other adjoyning Nations followed. But this is not the Law of Nations, properly ſo called. For it ſerves not to conglutinate all Nations mutually among themſelves; but rather to preſerve peace and tranquillity between the Subjects of every Nation: And was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alterable by any one people without conſulting the reſt, ſo that it may alſo come to paſs, That in other places and in other ages, a far different common cuſtom; and ſo, another Law of Nations, improperly ſo called, may be introduced: Which we have found really done, as ſoon as the <hi>German</hi> Nation had invaded all <hi>Europe.</hi> For as of old
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49430:83"/> the <hi>Graecian</hi> Laws, ſo then, the <hi>Germans</hi> were almoſt every where received, and do as yet flouriſh. The firſt way of gaining Dominion by the Law of Nations, as the <hi>Romans</hi> call it, is by the primary ſeizure or occupancy of ſuch things as have no owner, which without doubt is natural in that ſenſe which I have declared, that is, Dominion being firſt introduced, and ſo long as no Law did otherwiſe determine. For Dominion may alſo be gained by the Civil Law.</p>

                  <p>And hitherto in the firſt place we may refer the taking of Wild Beaſts, Birds and Fiſh. But how all theſe may be ſaid to belong to none, will afford matter of debate. <hi>Nerva</hi> the Son was of opinion, That Fiſh, if in a Pond, were poſſeſt, but not in a great Lake: And that Wild Beaſts, if in a Park or Warren, had an owner; but ranging in Woods hedg'd about, not. As though Fiſh incloſed in a greater Pond could not be as well owned as in a leſſer; and Deer and Conies as well poſſeſt in a well fenced Wood, as in a Park or Warren: Seeing that there is no more difference between them, than that in the one they are cloſe Priſoners, and in the other Priſoners at large. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this age of ours, the contrary opinion is moſt prevalent, That both Deer in private Woods, and Fiſh incloſed in Lakes may be, as poſſeſt, ſo alſo held in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>

                  <p>In Wild Beaſts, as ſoon as they recover their Natural Liberty, we loſe our Property, ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers. But in all other things the Dominion that is got by Poſſeſſion, is not loſt with the loſs of Poſſeſſion; nay, it gives us alſo a Right to recover our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: And whether it be taken away from us by another, or ſtray away of it ſelf, as in the caſe of a Fugitive Servant, it matters not much. (The Title we may retain though the Poſſeſſion be loſt.) Wherefore it ſeems more agreeable to truth, That our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is not loſt meerly becauſe the Beaſts that were wild have eſcaped our cuſtody; but becauſe it may probably be conjectured, That by reaſon of the difficulty of recovering them, we have utterly deſerted them; eſpecially when it cannot be known unto others that they were ours; But this conjecture may eaſily be wiped away by other conjectures, as namely, by affixing unto them <gap reason="foreign">

To acquire a full Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in things naturally wild, it is neceſſary that we ſhould have a Corporal Poſſeſſion: It is not enough to entitle our ſelves to a Deer, that we have wounded him; but we muſt catch him too, leſt the Proverb upbraid us with folly, <hi>In ſtarting an Hare for another to eat:</hi> According to that of <hi>Ovid,</hi>

The people of <hi>Germany</hi> conſulting about ſome allowances to be given to their Kings and Princes, whereby to ſupport their Regal Dignities, thought it prudence to begin with ſuch things as no private man could claim as his own: Which prudential courſe the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> alſo anciently took; where the Kings Attorney ſeized on all ſuch things to his Maſters uſe.

                  <p>Let us now proceed to Inundations or Increments by Rivers, whereof the ancient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers have written much, but the Modern whole Commentaries: But what they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is for the moſt part grounded not on the Law of Nature, but on the Laws of ſome Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though to gain the greater authority they oft-times put them off under that name. Moſt of their determinations being built upon this foundation, That the banks of the River are his who poſſeſſeth the adjoyning ſoil, and that the Channel, as ſoon as it is forſaken by the waters, is his alſo; and conſequently, thoſe Iſlands which are caſt up in the River. There they diſtinguiſh of Inundations, a ſmall one alters not the property of the ground, but a great one doth; yet ſo that if it come by reaſon of ſome ſudden and violent force of waters, and ſo recede, the ground overflown ſhall, upon the return of the waters, as if by poſtliminy, remain to its right owner: But if by a continual beating upon it, it waſh it away by degrees, it is loſt for ever. Now that all theſe might be introduced by ſome Law, to make men more carefully to defend their own banks, I deny not; but that they be ſo by a Natural Right (as they would have it) I cannot grant.</p>

And as in private Rivers, thoſe Iſlands which the waters caſt up, and that part of the Channel which the waters forſake, are properly his who owns the River; ſo in publick are both of them the peoples, or his, to whom the people hath given them. Now what is here ſaid concerning the Channels, may alſo be ſaid of the Banks, which are but the extreme parts of the Channel, wherein the River naturally runs; and thus it is every where taken. In <hi>Holland</hi> and the Countries adjacent, many ſuch diſputes did anciently ariſe, by reaſon of the lowneſs of the ground, the greatneſs of their Rivers, and their nearneſs to the Sea, receiving and caſting up by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate tides, mud and ſand: Thoſe that were Iſlands, truly ſo called, were always adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be part of the peoples patrimony; as alſo the whole Channel of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and of the Maſe, which the Waters have left, as it hath been frequently determined, and with

Neither can we admit of that as true naturally, which they averr, that if the Fields be bounded, the Iſlands are the firſt Occupants; for that indeed were true, in caſe that neither the River, nor with it the Channel, were at all poſſeſt by the people: for then they were like thoſe Iſlands which are raiſed in the Seas, his only that did firſt ſeize them.</p>

                  <p>Neither is that more to be admitted, which they write of a great Inundation, namely, that it gives away the property of the Land overflowed, if we reſpect only natural reaſon: For admit we do grant, that the ſuperficies of the Land may be diſſolved into Sand; yet do the lower parts thereof remain firm and ſolid, and though ſomewhat of the quantity be changed, yet is not the ſubſtance changed at all, no more than that part of a Field is, which is devoured by ſome Lake, the property whereof (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do rightly acknowledge) doth ſtill remain. Neither is that natural that they write, that an Inundation performs the office of a Judge or Cenſor, making that private which was publick, and that publick which before was private: as <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> ſpeaks of a ſurveyor, <hi>More vaſtiſſimi fluminis aliis ſpatia tollit, aliis concedit; That he was like a great River taking away from ſome that which of right was theirs, and giving unto others that wherein they had no right.</hi> Much better were it to follow that which <hi>Strabo</hi> reports of the <hi>Egyptians, To take an exact ſurvey of the Fields, and ſo divide unto every man his own by Admeaſurement: Becauſe the River</hi> Nilus <hi>by her frequent floods and rapid ſtreams, adding here and taking away there, and changing the form and marks of the Fields, doth ſo confound their bounds and limits, that it is hard for a man to diſtinguiſh between his own and another mans; therefore are Fields to be often ſurveyed.</hi> Whereunto agrees that tradition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers, <hi>Quod noſtrum eſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum eſſe non deſinit, niſi facto noſtro; That which is ours ceaſeth not to be ours without our own fact, or by ſome Law.</hi>

                  <p>Now becauſe there is one manner of right proper to Iſlands, and another to the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Rivers, Controverſies do often ariſe how to diſtinguiſh them, eſpecially when a little riſing ground lyes near the Fields adjacent, yet is ſeparated from them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of a little water that covers the Plain; as is often ſeen in the Low Countries where the ground is not level, where alſo the cuſtoms do ſomewhat vary: For in <hi>Gildria,</hi> if a loaden Wain can paſs through the Waters interjacent, then is the riſing ground judged to belong to the adjoyning Fields; ſo is it alſo in the Fields of <hi>Puttene,</hi> If a man ſtanding upon the bank, can with his Swords point touch the ground that lyes beyond the water.

But yet we muſt note, That many that are thus intruſted with theſe limited Governments, do together with them receive the profits of all the<note n="*" place="margin">Univerſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem agrorum.</note> Lands in general, except ſuch as are in the poſſeſſion of private men: Upon this preſumption, that thoſe Fields were anciently either the peoples, or the Princes, or at leaſt drained by the Prince; and if ſo, then doubtleſs whatſoever either the Prince or the people did ſo enjoy, their Vaſſals have a good right unto. Thus we ſee that in in <hi>Zealand,</hi> thoſe Vaſſals that have power to appoint Judges, though but in civil affairs, do pay a tribute to the State for their common Fields, whereof every man according to the tenure of his private poſſeſſion, bears his proportion. Now that theſe Vaſſals have a right to the increment of the Rivers, there can be no doubt: Others there are to whom the Rivers themſelves are granted, who may therefore juſtly claim the Iſlands thereunto belonging, whether they be of mud heaped up together, or made out of the Channel, if ſurrounded by the River. Others again there are, in whoſe grants neither the one nor the other is included, and theſe have but an ill cauſe to defend againſt the publick Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, unleſs either the cuſtom of the Country do favour them, or a long uninterrupted poſſeſſion (with ſuch adjuncts as are requiſite) give them a right.

                  <head>XI. Where the old <hi>Roman</hi> Empire now reſides.</head>
                  <p>It is alſo a famous Queſtion much controverted both by Hiſtorians and Civilians, To whom the rights belonging formerly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire do now appertain: Some ſay, to the <hi>German</hi> Emperor, which by I know not what deputation, they place in the room of it. But it is ſufficiently known, That the <hi>Great Germany,</hi> namely, that which lyes beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was but a little while within the pale of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: And to tranſlate the rights of Kingdoms from one to another without certain and evident proofs, ſeems to me to be too great a preſumption. Wherefore, I am of opinion, that the <hi>Roman</hi> people are now the ſame they were of old, though ſomewhat mixt by the acceſs of Foreigners; and that the Empire doth ſtill remain with them as in a Body Politick where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was and ſhould live. For whatſoever the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had of old a right to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had Emperors, that they had the ſame right to do in their <hi>Interregna,</hi> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of their Emperors. Yea, and the very Choice of their Emperors was their right; who were often made either by the people by themſelves, or by the Senate; yea,<note place="margin">From a Flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power, no Right can be certain. It is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for Soldiers to elect their Generals.</note> and thoſe Elections which were made by the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, (as ſuch there were, ſometimes by theſe, and anon by others) were not firm nor ſtable by any right that thoſe Legions had: (for from a Fleeting power no right can be certain), but by the approbation of the people. (When the two <hi>Roman</hi> Generals <hi>Publ.</hi> and <hi>Cn. Scipio</hi> were both ſlain, and the Army had choſen <hi>L. Martius,</hi> a valiant young Gentleman their Captain General, though he had vanquiſhed two ſeveral Armies of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and forced their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49430:88"/> Camps; yet notwithſtanding when in his Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> he had aſſumed that Honourable Title of Pro-Praetor, the Senate (conſidering that his Command was neither granted by the people, nor allowed of by themſelves) were much offended at his preſumption in uſurping it; fore-ſeeing well, that it was a matter of dangerous conſequence, for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers abroad to make choice of ſuch as ſhould command Armies and Provinces: And that the ſolemnity of Elections, ſo devoutly begun in the name of their Gods, ſhould now be transferr'd into Camps, far from Laws and Magiſtrates.) But yet we have many examples of Elections made by their Armies; but ſo, as they were afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and confirmed by the Senate: as were thoſe of <hi>Adrian, Pertinax, Julian, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, Macrinus, Maximinus, Baldinus, Aurelian</hi> and others. <hi>Capitolinus</hi> records an Epiſtle of <hi>Albinus</hi> concerning the right of the Senate in the Election of their Emperour, and another of the Senate concerning the <hi>Gardiani. Macrinus</hi> in an Oration thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks the Senate concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, <hi>They have conferred the Empire on me, the defence whereof, O Fathers Conſcript, I do in the mean time undertake: and if it be as pleaſing to you, as it hath been unto them, I ſhall alſo undertake the Government.</hi> So alſo doth the Emperour <hi>Tacitus</hi> in <hi>Vopiſcus, Me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath the Senate made their Prince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prudent advice of the Army.</hi> To the like purpoſe is that of <hi>Majorinus</hi> to the Senate, <hi>Remember that I was made Emperour as well by your own Free Suffrages, as by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of your puiſſant Army. The Roman Empire</hi> (as <hi>Maximinus</hi> in <hi>Herodian</hi> tells his Soldiers) <hi>is not the poſſeſſion of any one man, but the Ancient Inheritance of the whole people of</hi> Rome; <hi>upon whoſe ſafety the Empire depends. And we together with you are to this purpoſe choſen, that they through our Care and Courage may live ſecurely.</hi> Neither doth it avail to the contrary, to ſay, That by the Conſtitution of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour, all that lived within the Verge of that Empire, were made <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens: For by that Sanction, all the Subjects of that Empire, were only made capable of ſuch rights and priviledges, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies and ſuch other Towns and Cities anciently had,<note place="margin">For <hi>Rome</hi> over all her Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Lady or a Queen, <hi>Zon.</hi>
                     </note> that were made free; namely, that they might uſe the ſame Laws, and be governed by ſuch Magiſtrates, as the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had. But the Foundation of the Empire was not ſo in any other people, as it was in the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> for this was not in the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors to grant, who could neither change the ſtate of the Empire, nor its manner of holding it. Neither did it at all detract from the right of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> that their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours changed the place of their reſidence from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The change of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat did not change the Empire.</note> For even then alſo was the choice of their Emperours made by ſuch of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom <hi>Claudian</hi> calls the <hi>Byzantine Romans:</hi> yet ſo, as that choice was to be confirmed by the whole body of the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> who like Princes, jealous of their own Soveraignty, alwayes preſerved the prerogative of their City, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Conſuls,<note place="margin">The Empire continued in the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> though the Emperor reſided at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

Nero</hi> in the fourteenth of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Annals, <hi>accuſeth his Mother for endeavouring to divide the Empire with him, by ſwearing to her ſelf the Praetorian Bands, and for hoping to put the ſame reproach upon the Senate and people:</hi> Whereas (as <hi>Priſcus</hi> notes) <hi>the Soveraignty of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire appertained not to women, but men.</hi> For after the death of <hi>Heliogabalus, it was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially provided, that no woman ſhould ever after be admitted into the Senate, and that he that ſhould do it, ſhould be accurſed to Hell.</hi> And it was obſerved by <hi>Tribellius</hi> as a matter of reproach, <hi>That</hi> Zenobia <hi>uſurped the Empire, and governed the Common-wealth, longer than was fit for a woman to do it.</hi> When the <hi>Byzantine Romans</hi> contrary to the mind and cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had ſubjected the whole Empire to the Empreſs <hi>Irene,</hi> they deſervedly revoked that Grant, which they had either expreſly or tacitly given them, and by their own power choſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Principal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen in the Vacancy of the Empire.</note> Emperour; which they publickly declared by their chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> For ſo alſo was the High Prieſt among the <hi>Jews</hi> alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, during the vacancy of their Kings. Now <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did always very prudently diſtinguiſh between the right they had to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Francks</hi> and <hi>Lumbards,</hi> and the right they had to the Empire; the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ancient Inheritance, the latter being entruſted unto him upon a new account: but afterwards the Kingdom of the <hi>Francks</hi> being divided into the Weſtern, which is now called <hi>France,</hi> and the Eaſtern, which is <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Almany,</hi> ſeeing that the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Francks</hi> did then begin to ſet over themſelves Kings by Election, (for even at that time the ſucceſſion to the Kingdom of the <hi>Francks,</hi> being as it were Aquatical, depended not ſo much upon any certain Law, as upon the choice of the people:) The <hi>Romans</hi> that they might enjoy a moſt aſſured protection, choſe not a King of their own, but him whom the <hi>Germans</hi> had admitted for their Emperour; yet ſtill reſerving unto themſelves, the right of either approving or rejecting him, ſo far as concerned their own affairs. And this approbation is in their name ſolemnly witneſſed by their chief Citizen the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49430:88"/> by a peculiar Coronation. Wherefore as he that is admitted or elected by the ſeven Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> being the Repreſentatives of the whole Nation, hath according to their cuſtoms the beſt title to the Empire: So is the ſame perſon by the approbation of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> made King or Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or as Hiſtorians ſometimes call him, King of <hi>Italy.</hi> As in the excommunication of the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> the Pope makes expreſs mention of the Kingdoms of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and in the Oath that the Pope adminiſtred unto the Emperour <hi>Otto</hi> (as <hi>Gratian</hi> records) the Emperour ſwears, <hi>That he will make no Decree or Ordinance concerning any thing belonging to the Pope or to the</hi> Romans <hi>without his Counſel.</hi> So that the Emperour under the Title of being King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> hath a right unto all that did formerly belong unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that hath not been otherwiſe alienated or granted away, either by agreement, or by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy, upon a preſumption of being deſerted, or by the right of Conqueſt.

                     <hi>and him that is a Thief or a Robber; Pari loco habeo, res alienas non reddentem, cum raptore.</hi> Yet doth this obligation reach no farther, than as far as in us lyes; for no man is bound to impoſſibilities, nor to reſtore any thing that is loſt at his own charge: but to declare his knowledge to the right Owner, that ſo if he pleaſe, he may recover them. For as there is an equality to be obſerved, where any thing is held in common, that it may be made uſe of no leſs by one than another; So Dominion being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, this is mutually agreed on between the Proprietors, That if a man be poſſeſt of another mans Goods, he ſhould reſtore them to their right Owner. Now if this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation extended no farther than to reſtore upon demand, it would both too much weaken the future property, and aggravate the charge of keeping the thing loſt. Neither is it in this place regarded, whether a man hath got the poſſeſſion of another mans Goods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly or diſhoneſtly: For there is one manner of obligation ariſing from the crime, and another ariſing from the thing held and detained by that crime. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> thought they had expiated the Injury done to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> by laying an heavy Fine upon <hi>Phaebidus;</hi> who contrary to the League between them and the <hi>Thebans,</hi> had poſſeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the <hi>Cadmaean</hi> Fort, though they reſtored it not.

But becauſe this obligation as by an univerſal Contract binds all men, and creates a certain right to the Owner of the thing, hence it comes to paſs, that all ſingular Contracts, as being poſt-nate, do from hence receive their exception, which ſeems to illuſtrate that of <hi>Tryphoninus: A Thief delivers that whereof he hath robbed me, to</hi> Sejus <hi>to keep for him,</hi>

                     <hi>who is altogether ignorant of the theft. Now the Queſtion is, To whom is</hi> Sejus <hi>bound to reſtore it? If we look only to the Giver and Receiver, it is juſt that the thing intruſted, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him that gave it. But if we reſpect the equity of the matter, which takes in all the perſons concerned, it ought to be reſtored doubtleſs to me, from whom it was fraudulently taken.</hi> Whereunto he adds, <hi>Et probo hanc eſſe Juſtitiam, quae ſuum cuique ita tribuit, ut non diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatur ab ullius perſonae juſtiore repetitione; And this I approve of to be Juſtice, which ſo gives to every man his own, that it be not withheld from the juſter claim of any other perſon that hath a right unto it.</hi> Now his muſt needs be the juſter title, that claims by a right as ancient as propriety it ſelf: Whence it likewiſe follows, That he that ignorantly accepts of that from another in truſt, which afterwards he knows to be his own, cannot be bound to reſtore it. And the caſe which the ſame <hi>Tryphoninus</hi> puts, concerning Goods depoſited by him whoſe whole Eſtate was before confiſcate, is better determined by this rule, than by that which he there produceth, concerning the profits gained by puniſhments. For if we look ſtrictly to the nature of the propriety, it matters not whether it ariſe from the Law of Nations, or from the Civil Law; for either way it carries with it all things natural unto it ſelf, whereof this is one, That every perſon being poſſeſt of another mans goods, is bound to make reſtitution thereof to the right Owner. And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Martianus,</hi> where he tells us,<note place="margin">Res condici poſſunt ab iis qui non ex juſta cauſa poſſident.</note> that Goods may by perſonal actions at Law be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from thoſe, who without any juſt cauſe are poſſeſt of them.

                  <p>Of things not extant the Law of Nations runs thus, That if another be enriched by what is mine, I not enjoying mine own, he ſtands obliged to reſtore to me ſo much, as he is made the richer by what is mine: Becauſe as to that which he hath gained by what is mine, he hath the more, and I for want of what is mine own, have the leſs, by ſo much as he hath gained. For dominion was therefore generally agreed on, that every man according to his proportion, ſhould enjoy his own. <hi>Contra naturam eſt,</hi>

                     <hi>ex hominis Incommodo ſuum augere Commodum; For one man to enrich himſelf by that, which is another mans loſs, is unnatural,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi> And in another place, <hi>That we ſhould build up our own Power, Fortunes or Wealth, upon the ruine of other mens, nature it ſelf will not permit.</hi> There is ſo much of natural reaſon in this ſaying, that the Lawyers are enforced to decline the preſcript Rules of their Laws, and to determine many Caſes by this of equity, as being the moſt convincing. A Contract made by a Servant, being a Factor, ſhall bind his Maſter, unleſs Proclamation be firſt made, that no credit ſhall be given unto him. But yet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch Proclamation be made, if that Servant makes any profit thereby, either to himſelf, or puts it to his Maſters account, it ſhall be judged a Fraud; <hi>Videtur enim dolum malum facere, qui ex aliena jactura lucrum quaerat: For he ſeems to deal deceitfully, that makes himſelf rich by another mans loſs.</hi> Where the words <hi>Dolus malus</hi> ſignifie whatſoever is repugnant to natural right and equity. If a Wife ſhall give unto her Husband money, which by the Law, ſhe may require of him again, the Wife ſhall have either a perſonal Action againſt her Husband, or ſhall relieve her ſelf by that which was bought with her money: Becauſe it cannot be denyed, but that the Husband is made the richer by it; and therefore enquiry ſhall be made, what he poſſeſſeth that was bought with her money. So again, if thou haſt ſpent or otherwiſe diſpoſed of money, which my Servant hath ſtoln from me, conceiving it to be his; I have a good Action againſt thee, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe my Goods came into thy poſſeſſion without any juſt cauſe. Pupils, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, are not bound to pay what they borrow; yet if it appear, that they are the richer by what they borrowed, an Action ſhall lye againſt them. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if thou contracteſt with my debtor, not as mine, but ſuppoſing him to be another mans, and borroweſt my money of him, Thou ſtandeſt bound to pay me; not becauſe I truſted thee with my money, (which could not be without mutual Conſent) but becauſe my money coming into thy poſſeſſion, it is both juſt and righteous, that thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to me, as to the right Owner.</p>
                  <p>Our modern Lawyers do prudently judge of other the like Caſes by theſe, as namely, that he whoſe Goods, whilſt he lay concealed had been ſold, when he might have had an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49430:90"/> exception ſhould be admitted to receive the money that was raiſed by the ſale of them. And that he that accommodates the Father with money for his Sons maintenance, if the Father be not able to diſcharge the debt, ſhould have his Action againſt the Son, if he enjoy any Goods that were his Mothers. Theſe two Rules being throughly underſtood, may guide us to give ſatisfaction in ſuch Caſes of Conſcience, as are uſually by as well Lawyers as Divines, propoſed.</p>

For though without the thing, thoſe fruits could not be perceived, yet are they not due to the thing it ſelf, which without his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour could not have produced them.

                     </note>. For in this caſe, what the Owner would willingly have ſpent to have recovered his Goods, may be deducted by him that delivers them. For the very regaining of the poſſeſſion being not to be done without charge and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, is accordingly to be valued; which charge and trouble being ſaved, the right Owner (having thus loſt his thing) is reputed by ſo much the richer. And therefore ſince the buying this thing in the ordinary judgement of the Law be of no value; yet as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer ſaith, It is valuable, if from the beginning it be agreed, that the poſſeſſion of what is ours (being at preſent in another mans power) may be bought. And where things ſo bought, are ſtrictly required by the Owner without any moderate allowance,<note place="margin">Summam Jus ſumma Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. <hi>Ter. loc. ſupradicto.</hi>
                     </note> though it may ſtand with the Rigour of the Law, yet hath this Rigour ſo much of Injuſtice in it, as the one is a gainer by the others loſs.

So the Owners of ſuch Goods, as in a Tempeſt to ſecure the reſt, are caſt over-board, ſhall recover a part of their loſſes from thoſe whoſe Goods remain entire: becauſe he whoſe Goods are ſo preſerved by the loſs of mine, is by my damage made the richer.</p>

                  <head>I. That Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Right may ariſe from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</head>
                  <p>BY our Method formerly deſigned, we are now to treat of obligations made by Promiſe; where we find <hi>Franciſcus Connanus,</hi> a man eminently learned, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us, who holds, That thoſe Promiſes that are not made for a valuable conſideration, oblige not, either by the Law of Nature or Nations. And yet he confeſſeth, That they might juſtly be performed, in caſe the thing promiſed be ſuch as might juſtly and honeſtly be fulfilled, though no ſuch Promiſe had been made. To confirm which opinion, he produceth not only the teſtimonies of ſome Lawyers, but theſe Reaſons alſo: Firſt, That he who believes every raſh Promiſe cauſleſly made, is no leſs to be blamed than he that believes none at all. Secondly, That it would endanger moſt mens Fortunes, were men bound to perform all their Promiſes, which for the moſt part are made more out of oftentation, than a premeditated Will and Purpoſe to fulfil them. Laſtly, That it is fit that ſome things ſhould be left to every mans honeſty, and not to reduce all promiſes to a neceſſity of Performance. And whereas it is ſaid, That it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt not to perform what we have promiſed, the meaning is not that it is unjuſt, but that it argues lightneſs and inconſtancy in the Promiſer. Thus pleads <hi>Connanus,</hi> urging beſides the Teſtimony of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who denies that thoſe promiſes are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which are to them to whom they are made, unprofitable; or that infer more damage to him that made them, than benefit to them to whom they are made. But yet in caſe the matter be not entire, (ſomething having been performed by the one party) then he would have the other party obliged, not unto all that was promiſed, but unto that only that is in difference between them: And for thoſe agreements that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not binding, they receive their obliging power, either from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract wherein they are, or whereunto they are adjoyned, or from the delivery of the thing: From whence ariſe, partly Actions, partly Exceptions, and prohibited Reclaims. But as to thoſe that may have their obligatory power according to the Laws, as thoſe made by ſtipulation, with ſome others, they receive their binding faculty from the benefit of the Laws, whoſe efficacy is ſuch as to make that which in it ſelf is only honeſt, to be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49430:91"/> even neceſſary. But this opinion of <hi>Connanus,</hi> taken ſo generally as he ſeems to expreſs it, cannot be current: For in the firſt place it would thence follow, That thoſe Articles of Agreement that are made between Kings, and between the people of diverſe Nations, ſo long as nothing was on either ſide performed, were of no force; eſpecially, in ſuch places where are no ſet Forms of Leagues or Sponſions found. Beſides, no Reaſon can poſſibly be given why Laws (which are but as it were ſo many common Covenants or Promiſes of the people, for ſo both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> term them) ſhould add ſuch an obliging force unto Agreements. And yet that every mans own Will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all means to oblige it ſelf, cannot do the ſame thing; eſpecially where the Civil Law gives no reſtraint or Impediment unto it. Whereunto add, That the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a thing may be transferred by the Will being ſufficiently declared: And why therefore may not the Will have the ſame Right over a perſon, either to transfer Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion (which Right is leſs than Dominion it ſelf) or to do ſomething, ſeeing that we have the ſame power over our Actions, as we have over our Goods? And herein like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have the conſent of the learned. Nay, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hold that where the thing conſulted about, will not admit of delay, our ſilence is equivalent to a Sponſion. For as the Lawyers ſay, No Title can be naturally more aſſured, than that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor doth willingly transfer to another: In the ſame manner it is ſaid there is nothing ſo fit to preſerve faithful dealing among men, as to obſerve and perform whatſoever is promiſed and agreed upon between themſelves. So a Decree for the payment of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney promiſed, though there were no other reaſon aſſigned why it ſhould be due, but the free conſent of him that promiſed it, is ſaid to be agreeable to Natural equity. He, ſaith <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer, doth naturally owe, and by the Law of Nations muſt give,<note place="margin">Condictione Indebiti.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe word and promiſe we have relied: Where in the firſt place we muſt obſerve, That this word. <hi>[Oportet] Muſt,</hi> implies a kind of neceſſity: Neither may we admit of that which <hi>Connanus</hi> takes as granted, That we are then ſaid to rely upon a mans faith, when the thing ceaſeth to be entire (that is, when ſomething is already performed by one party.) For <hi>Paulus</hi> in that place treats of a perſonal Action brought for a thing not due, which preſently ceaſeth as ſoon as ſomething (upon what agreement ſoever) is paid: Becauſe, even before, when nothing was as yet performed on either ſide, by the Laws of Nature and Nations, what was promiſed, ought to be given; although the Civil Law, to prevent the occaſions of unneceſſary ſuits, do give little or no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to exact it.

                  <head>V. To make a Promiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, the uſe of Reaſon is required in the Promiſer.</head>
                  <p>And in the firſt place it is requiſite that he that promiſeth ſhould be endued with Reaſon, which renders the Promiſes of Mad-men, Ideots, and Infants void, and of no force; but the caſe of Minors is ſomewhat different: For although they are believed to be but of weak judgement, as Women alſo are; yet neither is this weakneſs of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laſting, nor is it of it ſelf ſufficient to invalid their acts. At what years a young man or woman arrives at the uſe of Reaſon cannot certainly be determined, but muſt be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at, either by their daily Actions, or by the Cuſtomes of every Nation: Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> a young man after thirteen years of age might oblige himſelf by any ſolemn Promiſe he ſhould make, and a young woman after twelve. But the Civil Laws, upon better reaſon, thought good to make void many of their Promiſes, not only among the <hi>Romans,</hi> but among the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And againſt ſome they introduced the benefit of Reſtitution: But theſe are the peculiar effects of the Civil Law, and do no whit apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Laws either of Nature or Nations; except only in this, that where they are received, it is agreeable to Nature that they ſhould be obſerv'd. Inſomuch that if a Foreigner ſhall contract with a Citizen, he ſhall be bound up by the Laws of that City, as if he were, for that time, a Subject of that Nation. But it were otherwiſe in caſe ſuch a Contract were made either on the Seas, or in ſome deſart Iſland, or by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between two perſons inhabiting diverſe Nations. For then ſuch Agreements ſhould be regulated by the Law of Nature only, as are the Agreements made between ſuch as are inveſted with the Supreme Power, as they are ſuch: For in theſe, what they do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, may by their Laws be made void, when it is done in favour to thoſe powers, but not when done to their Puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>Concerning a Promiſe made by an error or miſtake in the perſon promiſing, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is yet more difficult. For we are to diſtinguiſh between that Error which is about the ſubſtance of the thing promiſed, and that which concerns not the ſubſtance; and then we are to conſider whether the Fraud gave occaſion to the Promiſe or not. Again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he with whom we have to do be guilty of the Fraud or not. And laſtly, Whether the Act be ſtrictly due, or binds only in Honeſty and Conſcience. For the opinions of Lawyers do vary according to the variety of theſe caſes, declaring ſome acts to be void
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49430:92"/> and others valid. But ſo, that according to his will and pleaſure that is injured, the promiſe may be either revoked or reformed. But moſt of theſe diſtinctions proceed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; as well from the old Civil Law, as from the Praetorian: And ſome of them are either not altogether true, or not well digeſted. But yet it ſufficeth to chalk out a way for us to find out the natural truth; for as concerning the force and efficacy of Laws, this hath ever been allowed of by the general conſent of almoſt all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That when a Law is enacted upon the preſumption of ſuch a Fact as was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo done as was ſuggeſted, and believed, that Law is not obliging, becauſe the truth of the Fact failing, the foundation of that Law faileth with it. But when a Law is grounded upon ſuch a preſumption, may be gathered from the matter of that Law, from the Words, and from other Circumſtances. The like may be ſaid in this caſe, if a Promiſe be made upon the belief of ſuch a fact as indeed never was done, that Promiſe naturally is of no force; becauſe the Promiſer did not give his conſent abſolutely to the thing promiſed, but upon ſuch a condition (if not expreſt, yet preſumed) as really was not: As in that caſe mentioned by <hi>Cicero,</hi> of him who falſly believing his own Son to be dead, appointed a ſtranger to be his heir. And yet in caſe the Promiſer were neglective, either in his diligence to examine and ſearch out the truth of his Sons death, or in his care of expreſſing his own ſenſe, and did thereby occaſion any damage to the perſon to whom he made that Promiſe, he ſhall be obliged to repair it: Not upon the account of his Promiſe made, but for the damage, which through his neglect, was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by him to whom it was made; whereof we ſhall ſpeak more anon. But if there were an error or miſtake in the perſon promiſing, and yet that Error was not the cauſe of the Promiſe made, the act ſhall be valid, becauſe there was nothing wanting of a true conſent: But if in this caſe alſo the perſon to whom the Promiſe was made, did by any fraud of his, directly or indirectly, occaſion that error, what damage ſoever ſhall accrue to the Promiſer by reaſon of that Error, ſhall be by him repaired. But if the Promiſe were but in part occaſioned by an Error, then as to the other part the Promiſe ſhall ſtand good.</p>

                  <p>Concerning thoſe Promiſes that are made through Fear, queſtions do ariſe no leſs perpiext. For herein they do uſually diſtinguiſh of Fears, which are either great and vehement, or light and ſlender: If great, then they conſider whether it be ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in reſpect only of the perſon fearing: Then whether it be occaſioned juſtly or unjuſtly; and whether by him to whom the Promiſe was made, or by ſome other: As alſo they diſtinguiſh of the Acts, whether free and generous, or grievous and burdenſome; and according to this diverſity, are ſome Acts ſaid to be void, others revocable at the pleaſure of the Promiſer, and others to be wholly renewed. Concerning every one of theſe caſes, there are great differences in opinions. But I do wholly incline to thoſe who hold, That ſetting aſide that Authority of the Civil Law, which ſometimes takes away, and ſometimes moderates the binding power of ſuch promiſes: He that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth any thing through Fear, is obliged to perform what he hath ſo promiſed; becauſe the conſent he gave was not conditional, as in the caſe of Error, but abſolute. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> well obſerves, He that for fear of being ſhipwrackt, throws his goods overboard,<note place="margin">Eth. Nic. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> would willingly preſerve them on condition that he might not be wreckt; but upon a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of the preſent danger he is in, he abſolutely reſolves that his goods ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than himſelf, ſhall periſh. But yet we muſt alſo crave this allowance, That if he to whom the Promiſe was made, did occaſion not a juſt, but an unjuſt Fear, though but ſlight; and that thereupon the Promiſe was ſo made, he is bound to diſcharge the Promiſer if he deſire it: Not that the Promiſe is in it ſelf void, but for the damage that he ſuſtained who made it, by reaſon of the injury done him.<note place="margin">See <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.6.19. and <hi>P.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 19. §. 1.</note> But what excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Law of Nations admits herein, ſhall in its proper place be hereafter explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But that ſome Acts are reſcinded, which were made through Fear, being occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned not by him with whom we have to do, but by another, is an effect of the Civil Law, which doth often either null or revoke Acts, though freely done, if they that do them be of weak Judgement. <hi>Seneca</hi> argues according to the Law of Nature, when he tells us, <hi>That whatſoever either Force or Fear or Neceſſity makes us to grant,</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place, we may be ſure, That no Promiſe can bind us to that which is in it ſelf unlawful: For, <hi>Id poſſumus quod jure poſſumus; That only we can do, which we can
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49430:93"/> do, which we can lawfully do.</hi> All promiſes receive their vigor from his Right that makes them, beyond which they are of no force. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being once challenged upon his promiſe, anſwered, <hi>Bene ſi juſtum ſit, ſeu minus dixi tantum, non &amp; promiſi; Ye do well to urge it, if what I promiſed were juſt; but if not, I only ſaid it but did not promiſe it.</hi> But if the thing promiſed be not now in our power, but may be, then doth the ſtrength of that Promiſe hang in ſuſpence; becauſe the Promiſe was but conditional, namely, if at any time it ſhall lye in my power. But if that condition whereby the thing may be in our power, be alſo in our power, then is he that made the Promiſe, obliged to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is morally fit, that his Promiſe may be fulfilled. But the Civil Law nulls many Promiſes of this kind alſo for profit, which the Law of Nature would bind us unto: As when a man or woman ſhall promiſe to marry another hereafter, being now already mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: And not a few other Promiſes made by Minors and Children, whileſt under their Parents tuition.</p>

                  <head>XI. Whether a Promiſe made to do an act ſimply evil obligeth.</head>
                  <p>But here it may be demanded, Whether a Promiſe for the performance of an act in it ſelf vicious, doth naturally oblige: As if a man ſhould Promiſe a Reward to him that ſhould kill another. That this is a wicked Promiſe doth ſufficiently appear by this, That it was made to excite a man to do a wicked Act. But yet not every thing that is viciouſly done, doth loſe the effect of a juſt Right, as is manifeſt in things prodigally given, wherein notwithſtanding there is this difference, That ſo ſoon as the gift is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally given,<note place="margin">Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally given may lawfully be retained.</note> the obliquity ceaſeth: For the gift contracts no ſoil from the giver, and therefore it may without ſin be poſſeſt by thoſe to whom it is given. But in Promiſes made to a vicious end, the vice remains ſo long till the crime be perpetrated: For ſo long the very fulfilling of the Promiſe being an incentive to vice, muſt needs be ſinful; which begins to ceaſe, when the crime is committed. Whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the force and efficacy of ſuch a Promiſe until that time did hang in ſuſpence, as I ſaid before, concerning the thing promiſed, being not in our own power. But the crime being done, then the obligation ariſing from that promiſe breaks ſorth, which from the beginning was not intrinſically wanting, but hindred by a vice that was accidental. An example hereof we have in <hi>Judah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi>

Though it be otherwiſe by the Civil Law, as may appear by the ſentence which <hi>C. Aquilius</hi> paſt in the like caſe. But in caſe that Promiſe were occaſioned by the fraud or injuſtice of the perſon to whom it was made, or if it were made upon any unequal terms or conditions, how it is to be rectified, is another Queſtion, whereof we ſhall ſpeak anon.</p>

                  <p>But that a Promiſe ſhould transfer a Right in the thing promiſed, the acceptance of him to whom it is promiſed, is no leſs requiſite, than it was in the caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid of Alienation: And herein <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of Faſts, ſpeaks like a Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>Votum cum à Deo acceptatum eſt, Legem in poſterum facit; A Vow,</hi> (though freely made, yet) <hi>when it is by God accepted, is as binding as a Law.</hi> And here alſo a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding demand of a thing promiſed, (if no alteration appear) ſhall be judged an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.

Not much unlike unto that which the Law of Nations hath introduced in favour to Infants, Ideots and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

And certain it is, that either way the Promiſe made may be binding: As for Example, either thus, This will I do if it ſhall be accepted; or thus, This I will do, if I ſhall underſtand that it will be accepted. And if the Promiſe do imply a mutual obligation on both ſides, then it is to be underſtood in the latter ſenſe. But if the Promiſe be free and ſponta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neous, then it is beſt to believe that it was meant in the former ſenſe, unleſs it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear otherwiſe.</p>

                  <p>Again, Hence it follows, That ſuch a Promiſe made before Acceptance (for till then no Right paſſeth) may be revoked, without the imputation of either Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yea, or Levity, if it were really ſo intended, when made, That it ſhould not be of Force, till it were accepted, ſo till then it could transfer no Right. It may alſo be revoked, in caſe the perſon ſhall dye to whom ſuch a Promiſe was made, before he hath accepted of it. Becauſe the Acceptance was referred to his own choice, and not to his heirs. For it is one thing, to be willing to give away my Right to ſuch a man, to be by him transferred to his Heirs; and another thing, to be willing to give it unto his Heirs immediately: It is very material to conſider on whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a benefit. Of this opinion was <hi>Neratius,</hi> who could not believe that a Prince would have granted that to him being dead, which he had granted unto him, believing him to be alive.</p>

                  <head>XVII. Whether it may be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, if the party dye who was authorized to make it. Explained.</head>
                  <p>A Promiſe may alſo be revoked upon the death of the perſon who was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to make it; becauſe the binding power was in his words: But not ſo, if the grant be ſent by a Meſſenger or a Carrier, becauſe the obliging power is not in him, but in the Inſtrument he carries. And therefore thoſe Letters importing the conſent of the party may be conveyed by any man. We muſt alſo diſtinguiſh between him that is deputed only to ſignifie the Promiſe we make, and him that is authorized by us to make that Promiſe himſelf. In the former caſe a revocation ſhall take place, although it be not ſo expreſt to him that carries the Promiſe or Grant: In the latter caſe, the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is of no force; becauſe the obliging power depended upon the Will of him that is ſent to make it; who if he do make it whileſt it is in his power ſo to do, that is, before the revocation be made known unto him, the grant ſhall be valid, and the perſon that made it juſtified. So alſo in the former caſe, though the Donor dye, yet may the gift be accepted, as being on his part perfect and compleat, although ſubject to a revocation: which is apparent in Ambaſſadours. But in the latter caſe it cannot, becauſe the gift is not actually given, but only commanded to be given. But where the matter will admit of a debate, it may be preſumed, that the will of the Prince was, That his Commands ſhould be executed, unleſs ſome great alteration ſhould happen in the mean time: As namely, the death of the perſon commanding. 'Tis true, there may be many conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that may be of force to perſwade us to think otherwiſe, which may eaſily be admitted, That ſo what was in a good cauſe commanded to be given, may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding abide with us. And thus may that queſtion that hath been heretofore muted, be anſwered, Whether the heir of him that was ſo commanded, may be ſued at Law.</p>

                  <head>XVIII. Whether a Promiſe be revocable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath been accepted of by another.</head>
                  <p>Controverſies alſo do uſually happen, concerning the accepting of a thing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of another: Wherein alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between that Promiſe that is made to me of ſomething to be given to another, and that promiſe which is made in the name of him to whom the thing is to be given. If the Promiſe be made to me (ſetting aſide that Query introduced by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, Whether any benefit do accrue unto me by it.) The Right of accepting the thing ſeems naturally to be given to me, and the power of transferring that Right unto another, if he alſo will accept thereof; ſo that he that made the Promiſe hath no Right in the mean time to revoke it; but I to whom the Promiſe was made may remit it. For this ſenſe, as it is no whit repugnant to the Law of Nature, ſo is it moſt agreeable to the words of ſuch a Promiſe: Neither can it be ſaid, not at all to concern me, That another by me ſhould receive a benefit. But if the Promiſe be made in his name to whom the thing is to be given, we muſt then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether he that accepts of what is promiſed, hath a Special Command ſo to do, or an order ſo general, as may be thought ſufficient to include it; or whether he hath no ſuch order at all. If it do appear that he hath ſuch order or authority to accept thereof, I do not then conceive it neceſſary to enquire any farther, Whether the perſon ſo impowred be a Free-man or not, as is uſually done by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; but conclude rather, That the Promiſe is fully compleat by that acceptance: For it ſufficeth to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our conſent, though by a Servant, whoſe will is reputed ours, if we authorize him, and he accept thereof. But if he that accepts of the Promiſe, have no ſuch order from him to whom the Promiſe is made, but is deputed by the Promiſer, then hath the Promiſer no power to revoke the Promiſe, until he whom it concerns, do either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof, or reject it. Yet ſo, notwithſtanding, That he, who in the mean time, hath accepted of the Promiſe made, hath no power to remit it, becauſe he is not depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accept of any Right to the thing promiſed, but to bind the Promiſer to obſerve and perform his Promiſe, in ſuſtaining the thing promiſed: So that if the Promiſer ſhall retract, he may be ſaid to break his Faith, but he cannot be ſaid to invade any mans Right or Propriety.</p>

                  <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it may eaſily be conceived, what we are to judge concerning ſuch a charge as is uſually added unto a Promiſe. For ſuch a charge may be impoſed, as long as the Promiſe is not yet made perfect by acceptance, nor the Faith of the Promiſer given, that it ſhall be irrevocable. But yet this charge added for the uſe and benefit of a third perſon is alſo revocable, until it ſhall be by that third perſon accepted: Although ſome there be, that, as well in this, as in other the like queſtions, are otherwiſe perſwaded.

For the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of which Promiſes, ſome are of opinion, that nothing is requiſite but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of the mind, which being conjoined with the former external act, ſufficeth to contract a firm obligation. Others diſallowing this, becauſe they cannot admit that any outward Act ſhould be a competent ſign of an internal act ſubſequent to it, do require a new verbal Promiſe and Acceptance. But the middle opinion is the ſafer, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome outward act, but not ſuch as is verbal, ſeeing that the retaining of the thing promiſed by the perſon to whom it was promiſed, and the relinquiſhing of it by the perſon promiſing, or ſome ſuch like act, are ſufficient to teſtifie the mutual conſent of both parties.</p>

                  <p>Of thoſe that are Simple, ſome are Beneficent, others Permutatory: Such as are Beneficent, are either merely gratuitous or infer a mutual obligation: Such as are merely gratuitous, are either preſently done, or ſuch as extend to the time to come.

                  <p>Of ſuch Acts as do infer Profit by exchange, ſome divide and diſſipate the parts, others unite them, and ſo introduce Communion: Thoſe which divide and ſeparate the parts, the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers rightly diſtinguiſh into theſe three heads: <hi>Do ut Des, Facio ut Facias, Facio ut Des.</hi> Firſt, when we exchange one thing for another, the agreement runs thus; I'll give you this, if you'll give me that. 2. When we truck Deeds, then it runs thus; I'll do this for you, if you'll do that for me. The 3d. is mixt, as when we agree, That if I do this for you, then you ſhall give me that as the price or reward of my pains. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers do exempt from this Diviſion, ſome Contracts, which they call
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49430:95"/> 
                     <hi>Nominati;</hi> not ſo much becauſe they have proper names (for ſo have thoſe Contracts which are made by exchange alſo, which they will not admit amongſt their Nominate Contracts) But becauſe by reaſon of their more frequent and ordinary uſe, they had received ſome certain force, and were of ſuch a Nature, that though nothing at all had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſaid, yet by their very name they might have been ſufficiently underſtood. Hence it was, that to thoſe there were certain ſet forms of Actions appointed; whereas to others that were leſs ordinary, that common form was not ſufficient: But the plea muſt be made in a form fitted to the fact, and therefore it was ſaid to be in preſcript words. Neither is there any other cauſe but this of frequent uſe, why in theſe nominate conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if ſome things requiſite to a Contract were by both parties aſſented unto: As in the ſale of any thing, if the price were on both ſides agreed on, yea, though the matter were yet entire, (that is, if there were no mony paid, nor any thing performed on either ſide) yet was there enjoyned a neceſſity of fulfilling the Contract on both ſides; whereas in Contracts not ſo frequent, whilſt things ſtood entire, and nothing on either ſides per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there was indulged unto them a liberty to retract, that is to ſay, they might without any penalty revoke. For the Civil Law reſtrained all coercive power from ſuch Contracts, and left them wholly to the Faith and Honeſty of the Contractors: But the Law of Nature takes no cognizance of theſe diſtinctions; for neither are thoſe Contracts which they call Innominate, either leſs natural or leſs ancient. Nay even Bartering, which they reckon among thoſe that are Innominate, is both more ſimple and more ancient, than thoſe made by bargain and ſale. Thus <hi>Tacitus</hi> teſtifies of the <hi>Germans, That they uſed the more ſimple and ancient way of Traffick, that is, by exchange of Commodities.</hi> For as <hi>Servius</hi> rightly obſerved, <hi>Our Anceſtors did only exchange one thing for another. How much more happy was that Age,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny, when men exchanged Goods for Goods, the Native Commodities of one Country for thoſe of the growth of another.</hi> The like he relates of the <hi>Seres,</hi> a people of <hi>Scythia, Who having expoſed their Native Commodities to ſale on the farther bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they take away what they find to be ſet by it, if they are pleaſed with the exchange.</hi> Which kind of bartering of Commodities is yet in uſe in ſome parts of <hi>Africk:</hi> We therefore taking Nature for our beſt guide, do reduce all diremptory Contracts (without taking any cognizance of that <hi>Roman</hi> diſtinction of Nominate and Innominate agreements unto theſe three heads before named. When we give to receive, we either barter one thing for another, which doubtleſs was the ancient way of Traffick, or we receive mony for mony, as by Bills of Exchange; or we receive goods for mony, as in the caſe of buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; or we receive the uſe of a thing for another thing, or the uſe of one thing for the uſe of another, or the uſe of a thing for mony, as in things let and taken to hire. By the uſe of things we are to underſtand, not only the bare uſe of a thing, but alſo the fruits, profits, or proceeds of it, whether temporary, perſonal, hereditary, or any other way however limited or circumſcribed, as among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that which was held until the next Jubilee. Some things are given, that after ſome Intervals of time, are to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either in kind or to the ſame value, as in things that are lent; and this kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation is chiefly uſed, where the things exchanged do conſiſt in number, meaſure, or weight, whether it be mony or other things. The exchange of deeds for deeds do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vary, according to the no leſs infinite variety of humane actions. But when we do that we may receive, it is either work done for mony, as when for our daily labour we receive wages; and this alſo is a kind of letting our ſelves to hire for profit in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral callings: Or when by our voluntary act, we undertake to ſecure another mans goods from all caſualties or contingent misfortunes,<note place="margin">Enſurance.</note> which manner of contract was hardly known to former ages, though now of frequent uſe; or when we do ſomewhat to receive either things, or the uſe of things for our pains.</p>

For then only is this conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unjuſt, when it immediately concerns the thing that is to be contracted for; as in Houſes infected with the Peſtilence, or ordained by the Magiſtrates to be pulled down, or the like: For of theſe things there ſhould be, between the Buyer and Seller,<note place="margin">Par ſcientia.</note> an equal knowledg, for that makes them both equal.</p>

                  <p>In the very principal act of Contracting, there is alſo required this equality, that no more be exacted than what is fit, which rule is of no force in ſuch acts as are beneficent: For if I will give ſomewhat more by way of reward, either for work done at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or for things lent me, or for preſerving things depoſited, than is juſtly due; I do no man wrong, I do but mix the act by making it partly permutatory, and partly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous.

For example, That he who doth any thing in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to anothers Command, ſhould be ſaved harmleſs and indemnifyed, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his charges, as of any loſs ſuſtained by reaſon of the execution of that command. Again,<note place="margin">Things lent.</note> That he to whom any thing is freely lent, ſhould ſatisfie the juſt value, if the thing periſh in his cuſtody, becauſe he ſtands obliged to the owner not only for the thing it ſelf, but to be thankful for the courteſie done him in the loan thereof, unleſs it be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the thing ſo lent had certainly ſo periſhed, had it continued in the poſſeſſion of the right owner: For in this caſe he loſeth nothing by the Loan. But on the contrary, He with whom any thing is depoſited,<note place="margin">Things depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited.</note> receives nothing but a bare truſt; and therefore if the thing miſcarry he is not bound to repair the loſs: Neither in reſpect of the thing truſted, there being no ſuch in being, neither is the Truſtee any thing the richer for it; nor in reſpect of his acceptance of the truſt, becauſe thereby he receiveth no courteſie but doth one. And as to things pawned, as alſo in things let out to hire, a middle way is to be taken; for in every caſe of loſs the receiver is not bound to reſtitution, as he is to whom a thing is lent; yet is a much greater care required from him to preſerve it, than of that which is committed barely to truſt, becauſe the acceptance of it though gratuitous, yet uſually comes very neer unto ſuch Contracts as are burdenſom.

                  <head>XVII. How Money receives its value.</head>
                  <p>As for Money, the office it performs it naturally receives, not from the ſole matter, or metal, nor from its form or appellation, but from a more general relation, namely, as we counterpoiſe it with other things, eſpecially, with thoſe that are moſt neceſſary: Now the value that is put upon it, if it be not otherwiſe agreed on, muſt be according to the rate, that it bears at the time, and in the place, where payment is to be made. Now as <hi>Michael Epheſius</hi> rightly obſerves,<note place="margin">Ad. <hi>5.</hi> Nicom.</note> 
                     <hi>Money it ſelf varies as all other things do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plenty or ſcarcity of it; for as we have not always a like occaſion to uſe other things, and according to our deſire of them, ſo the prices riſe or fall: So Money doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways retain the ſame value, but ſometimes it is more and ſometimes leſs worth. But yet the price of Money is moſt laſting: Which we uſe chiefly as a counter-ballance to all other things wherewith it is compared.</hi> Now that which is the meaſure or ſtandard to all things ought in it ſelf to be conſtant. And therefore Gold, Silver, and Braſs by themſelves are of the ſame value almoſt always and in all places. And as other things that are uſeful or neceſſary, are either rare, or abounding, ſo the ſame Money in weight, and made of the ſame Metal is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs worth.</p>

                  <p>Next to buying and ſelling (as <hi>Cajus</hi> notes) is letting and taking to hire, and ſteered by the ſame Rules. That which anſwers to the price is the rent or hire, and that which anſwers to the Propriety, is the poſſeſſing and enjoying of the benefit of it. Wherefore as when the thing periſheth, the owner bears the loſs: So when the thing hired proves ſteril or barren, or by any other accident proves fruitleſs and unprofitable; the loſs is naturally the preſent occupiers: Neither hath the Lord any thing the leſs Right to the rent or hire agreed for, becauſe when he delivered the thing to him to uſe, it was ſo much worth as was contracted for. Although that may be changed, either by general Laws, or by Covenants between themſelves; yet notwithſtanding if he that firſt hired the thing be diſabled to make uſe thereof, and thereupon the owner let it to another, whatſoever he ſhall gain thereby, more than the hire firſt agreed for, he ſhall repay to him that firſt took it, leſt he ſhould enrich himſelf by that which is due to another man.</p>

                  <p>Again, what was before ſaid in the caſe of ſelling, namely, that the price may be more or leſs if the thing were only ſold to gratifie the buyer, but otherwiſe was neither to be bought nor ſold: The very ſame may be underſtood of any thing, or of any work let or taken for hire, in favour of him that requires it. But if a man by one and the ſame pains may accommodate diverſe perſons, as in conveying them from place to place, if he that undertakes it ſhall oblige himſelf entirely to every one of them, he may require the ſame reward from every one, as he exacted from the firſt, if the Law do not otherwiſe provide; becauſe that, by my labour a ſecond, third or fourth perſon receives a benefit doth no whit prejudice the Contract made with the firſt. And if the benefit be equal, ſurely the reward ought to be ſo too.</p>

                  <head>XX. By what Law Uſury is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</head>
                  <p>As concerning Money lent, it is frequently queſtioned by what Law Uſury is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: and although it be the moſt received opinion, That it is prohibited by the Law of Nature, yet was <hi>Albulenſis</hi> of a contrary Judgement, neither are thoſe arguments which are brought to prove the adverſe part of ſuch weight as to turn the Scale. For whereas it is ſaid of things lent, that they are lent freely, as much may be ſaid of things delivered to another to uſe; and yet if any thing be required for the uſe of either, it may haply cauſe the Contract to paſs by another name, but it cannot make the taking of a moderate price for the uſe of a thing unlawful. Neither is that argument which they draw from the ſterility of Money any thing more perſwaſive. For mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is able to make Houſes, Lands or any other thing, which in themſelves are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, to become fruitful. But that which ſeems to be the moſt plauſible Argument is this, That here one thing is given for another, as an Houſe for Rent. But the uſe of a thing cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the thing it ſelf,<note place="margin">Uſus in abuſu conſiſtit.</note> where the thing it ſelf <hi>periſheth by the uſing of it:</hi> And therefore for that nothing ought to be exacted. But here we muſt note, That when by the decree of the Senate, the fruits ariſing from the uſe of things, that either by their uſe periſh, or are transferred into the dominion of another was introduced by the Name of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſusfructus,</hi> (which properly ſignifies the profit that is gained by the uſe of anothers mans goods, the property remaining his own) they intended not by that word <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſusfructus,</hi> that it ſhould obtain the ſame effect of right with that which was properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For certainly the word ſo taken could not according to its Propriety agree with ſuch a Right. Neither will it thence notwithſtanding follow, That ſuch a Right is nothing, or not valuable: Since, on the contrary, it is certain, That if any man would yield up ſuch a Right to the Proprietor, Money may be required upon that account. So alſo the Right of not paying either Money or Wine borrowed, till after ſuch a time, is valuable: <hi>Minus enim ſolvit, qui tempore minus ſolvit; For he pays not his due that pays not in due time.</hi> And therefore in Lands mortgaged for Money, the profits of the Land ſhould anſwer for the uſe of the Money. Now what Arguments are brought by <hi>Cato, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> againſt Uſury, do not ſo much
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49430:97"/> reſpect the intrinſick nature of the thing, as the adjuncts and conſequences of it. What we are to do in this caſe, we may collect from the Law given by God to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which forbids them to lend money each to other upon Uſury. The ſubject matter of which Law, if it be not neceſſary, yet it is morally honeſt: And therefore in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. it is enumerated among ſuch as are highly Moral; as alſo in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. Some there are (ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi>) who place Uſury in the gain by money only;<note place="margin">See Pſal. 102. The good man is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and will guide his words with diſcretion.</note> but the Scriptures do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently take away all Immoderate Gain by any thing; and do require, that thou ſhouldſt take no more than thou gaveſt. Now ſuch Precepts as theſe are, do as well oblige Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we being called to be more excellent patterns of Vertue than they. Wherefore look what Moral duties the Law then enjoyned the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all that were circumciſed, for they were both herein equally obliged, the ſame ought now to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by all Nations, the partition-wall being now taken away by the promulgation of the Evangelical Law, which under the notion of <hi>Neighbour,</hi> comprehends all mankind; as by that excellent Apology of our Saviour concerning the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> moſt evidently appears. So <hi>Arnobius</hi> teſtifies of the Chriſtians of his time,<note place="margin">

                  <p>It is notwithſtanding to be obſerved, that there are ſome Contracts which have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Uſury, and are vulgarly ſo accounted, which yet are of another kind: As when the lender requires ſomewhat to repair the damage he hath ſuſtained, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the long detention of his money lent; or being fruſtrated of the hopes of gain that he might have made by it, deducting notwithſtanding ſomewhat in reſpect of the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe hopes, and alſo for the labour and hazard he muſt have run for it. So likewiſe, to defray the charges of him that lends money to many, and to that purpoſe keeps his money ready (with his Books of Account); and for the danger he runs of loſing the Principal where it is not ſufficiently ſecured. If any thing in theſe Caſes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it is not to be reputed Uſury. And if we would know, what opinion the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers had of it, we ſhall find, that as they hated the word <hi>Foenus;</hi> ſo they would eaſily admit of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura, non propter lucrum petentium, ſed propter moram ſolventium; Not that the lender deſired to make again by the wants of the borrower, but becauſe his money is not paid at the time agreed on.</hi> The difference being only this,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>[Foenus] is that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for, more than the principal, meerly out of a deſire of gain:</hi> But <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſura] is that which is given more than the principal, leſt the lender ſhould be damnified by the detention of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</hi> But ſince this word <hi>

Demoſthenes</hi> in his Oration againſt <hi>Pantaenetus,</hi> denyes peremptorily, that he deſerves to be branded with the name of an Uſurer, that lends what he hath got either by merchandizing, or by his honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>ſub modico lucello, for ſome moderate gain:</hi> partly that he may keep what he hath ſo got; and partly, that thereby he may gratifie another.

                     </note> but never took any thing that deſerved the name of Uſury. (True it is, that the Scriptures, the Fathers, the Canon Law and the Decretals do all declaim againſt Uſury, ſo do the Civilians: <hi>Baldus</hi> calls it a profitable Theft or Piracy. <hi>Bartolus</hi> condemns all Uſury, ſo do the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, and moſt Common-wealths; yet are they contented to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, being reſtrained and moderated. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Niſhech,</hi> ſignifies a biting or grinding Uſury, ſuch a lending of money, as under the pretence of Charity, devours the poor borrower. The matter that binds the Conſcience, is the Debtors gaining nothing by the money lent, and not the taking of much or little Intereſt. It is a more biting Uſury, to take 2 or 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of him that gets nothing, than to receive 6 or 8, of him that makes thereof a greater gain: which was the cauſe, that among the <hi>Romans,</hi> he that took Uſury of the poor, was more puniſhed, than he that robbed the rich. No man is by the Law bound, or ſo much as admoniſhed to lend to thoſe who have no need: And in caſe another man gain by what is mine, Natural equity requires that I ſhould be a gainer, by ſo much as he, by my means, is made the richer. Again, If to a man that ſtands in preſent want, I lend freely until ſuch a time prefixt, if he fail then of payment, and I thereby incur any damage, it is reaſon that he ſhould ſatisfie the damage, and ſo Intereſt may be due <hi>ex damno habito,</hi> for the loſs I ſuſtain. Alſo, if a Tradeſman lend his money which he

Again, four men are Partners in one Shop, two being Aged ſupply Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the other two being young and active, do take pains to improve it; if they by their labour and care gain 20 or 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and pay the other two being paſt their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, 6 or 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for their Maintenance, Can this be called Biting Uſury? If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That the two lenders take no pains, nor run any hazard; I anſwer, Yes, they did doubtleſs take pains when they were able, and they do now run an hazard by lending their money to them that are painful, but have nothing.

                  <p>But theſe humane Laws that tolerate a moderate gain, for the uſe of money or any other thing (as in <hi>Holland</hi> they permit 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to ſome, and 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to Merchants for a year, as a reaſonable compenſation for that loſs which the lender doth or may ſuſtain by the forbearance of his money) are no way repugnant to the Laws, either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Divine: But if they exceed this rate, thoſe Laws may afford Impunity, but no juſt Right.</p>

                  <p>A Contract for the enſuring of Goods from Caſualties either by Sea or Land, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void, if either of the Contractors do know, that the Goods are already ſafely arrived at the Port or place whither they were bound, or that they are periſhed by the way: not only in reſpect of that parity or equality of knowledge, that there ſhould be, between ſuch Contractors; but in reſpect of the ſubject matter of ſuch a Contract, which is a loſs, but uncertain, which in reſpect of both parties may, or may not be.

                  <p>In ſocial Negotiations where traffick is maintained by the joint Stock of a Company, if every member contribute an equal proportion in money, their gain or loſs, ſhall alſo be equal; but if their proportions be unequal, every member ſhall be rated according to his proportion: The like is to be obſerved, where the traffick is to be maintained by joint ſervice, accordingly as the ſervice is by agreement, either equally or unequally to be performed. But yet, in ſuch Negotiations, ſervices may be ſet againſt money, or againſt ſervice and money, ſo that they may anſwer one another, as it is uſually ſaid, <hi>Par pari datum hoſtimentum eſt opera pro pecunia; To give like for like, is to even the ſcales.</hi> But this may be done diverſe wayes; for, either ſervice may counterballance the bare uſe of money, in which caſe the principal ſtock whether preſerved or loſt, is entirely his gain or loſs that owns it, or the work or ſervice may counterballance the whole ſtock of money; in which caſe, he that doth the work, is partaker of the whole ſtock. In the former of theſe caſes, the work is ſet againſt, not the ſtock, but the danger of loſing it, or the gains that probably might be expected from it. In the latter caſe, the price of the labour is added unto the ſtock of money, and he that performs it, ſhall have a ſhare in the ſtock equivalent to it. But that either of the parties aſſociated, ſhould ſhare in the profit, and yet be indemnified in caſe of loſs, is preternatural to ſocieties; yet ſuch an Agreement there may be without injury: As when there is a mixt contract, partly by the ſociety, and partly for enſurance, wherein ſuch an equality may be obſerved, as that he that aſſumes to make good the loſs, ſhall receive a greater proportion of the gain, than otherwiſe he ſhould have had. But that any man ſhould bear the loſs, that partakes not of the gain, is inconſiſtent with a ſociety, whoſe principal end is common profit, without which it cannot conſiſt. Now, whereas the Lawyers ſay, That where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are not expreſly named, they are to be underſtood as if they were equal, this holds true only where other things contributed are alſo equal.</p>

Of this opinion was <hi>Pomponius,</hi> That naturally in buying and ſelling, it was lawful for one man to circumvent another: where the word <hi>Licitum</hi> is not the ſame with <hi>Fas;</hi> but it was ſo permitted,<note place="margin">And how this is ſaid to be Natural.</note> that there was no Remedy provided againſt it for him that was willing to juſtifie him by his Agreement: In which ſenſe that is termed Natural in this, and ſome other places, which is every where cuſtomarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

                     </gap>, when by long Cuſtome they are made natural unto us. Now how great the advantage of ſuch a Law if introduced, would be to the General Peace, is evident: for it would prevent infinite conteſts which would ariſe, concerning the uncertain prizes of Commodities, which could not poſſibly be determined or avoided, where there was no common Judge, if every man might break off from his agreement, upon pretence of ſuch an inequality. <hi>Haec eſt Emptionis &amp; ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis ſubſtantia,</hi> (ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, calling a perpetual Cuſtome by the name of Subſtance) <hi>This is the perpetual manner of buying and ſelling, the buyer beating the price as low as he can, and the ſeller drawing up the buyer as high as he can, till at length they agree in an equal and juſt value.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> reſpecting this very Cuſtome ſaith, <hi>What matter is it what any thing coſt, if the buyer and ſeller are agreed about the price? He owes nothing to the ſeller, that gets a good bargain.</hi> And much after the ſame Copy writes <hi>Andronicus Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, That which by the mutual conſent of the Contractors is gained, is neither unjuſt, nor ſhould it be amended: For the Laws do indulge a licence in theſe things.</hi> And he that writes the Life of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> calls the ſelling of any thing at too dear a rate, or the buying of any thing at too cheap a rate, <hi>An Injuſtice tolerated by the Law.

                  <p>IN all Contracts, Vows and Promiſes, the greateſt aſſurance that any Age or Nation could ever either give or require, of their Faith and Sincerity, is by Oath. This is an indiſſoluble bond, which whoſo violates, is deſervedly reputed as an execrable and accurſed thing both before God and men, whereof <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſpeaks thus,
<q>
                        <l>The mind that's ſtartled by a ſacred Oath,</l>
                        <l>Will carefully avoid two ſmarting Rods;</l>

                     <hi>Nullum vinculum ad aſtringendam fidem, majores noſtri jurejurando arctius eſſe voluerunt; Our fore-fathers,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero, never knew any thing ſtronger than an Oath, whereby to bind us to perform our promiſes:</hi> and to violate this bond, they alwayes accounted a ſin of the greateſt magnitude; neither did they believe any other ſin to be ſo ſeverely puniſhed, as this of perjury: ſo <hi>Heſiod</hi> teſtifies,
<q>
                        <l>Whence is't that mortal men thus plagued are?</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is one of thoſe ſins which draws down vengeance on our poſterity after us, and wherein the bare Will is puniſhed,<note place="margin">

Of both which, <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath given a clear example in one <hi>Glaucus,</hi> a man highly famed by the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> for his Vertues, but eſpecially for his Juſtice; with whom a Citizen of <hi>Miletum</hi> (confiding in a man of ſo great a repute) leſt depoſited a very great ſum of money, with a writing, deſiring him to keep both; and to pay the money to ſuch, as ſhould hereafter bring him a duplicate of that writing. <hi>Glaucus</hi> accepts of the money and condition; but when the money was demanded by his Sons, and the duplicate ſhewed, he denyed that he knew any thing of it; yet he told them, that he would rub up his memory, and in caſe he could retrieve it there, he would repay it: otherwiſe, he threatned to proceed againſt them according to the <hi>Graecian</hi> Laws. So diſmiſſing them for four months, and in that time conſulting the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> whether he might by his Oath make prey of the money, he received this ſtabbing Anſwer:

                  <p>
                     <hi>Glaucus</hi> hearing this, devoutly implores the Gods to forgive him; but is again anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That it was the ſame thing to tempt the Gods in this caſe, by the Will, as by the Deed. And though <hi>Glaucus</hi> did reſtore the money, yet the Curſe denounced by the Oracle did fall upon him: For in the third Age, <hi>Glaucus</hi> had neither Child, nor Houſe, nor any to inherit his Name, which alſo had been forgotten long ſince, but that his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might (like <hi>Lots</hi> Wifes pillar) deter others from the like attempt. <hi>Juvenal</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing this ſtory, concludes thus,

                  <p>There are ſome who hold, that though a man do ſeriouſly pronounce the words of an Oath, yet if it be not with a purpoſe to ſwear, he ſhall not be bound by that Oath: But that in ſpeaking the words of that Oath he ſins, by ſwearing raſhly. But it accords more with Divine truth, that he is bound to make good his words, whereof he hath called God for a witneſs: For that Act which of it ſelf was Obligatory, did proceed from a ſerious and deliberate mind: Wherefore though what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, be for the moſt part true, <hi>Quod ex animi tui ſententia juraveris, id non facere perjurium eſt; That not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, what we have deliberately ſworn, is Perjury:</hi> Yet is it to be underſtood, with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, unleſs he that ſwears, knows, or at leaſt believes, that he with whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, doth otherwiſe underſtand the words of the Oath. For he that calls God to witneſs the truth of what he ſaith, is obliged to perform his word in that ſenſe, wherein he thinks himſelf to be underſtood.

                  <p>This is that which the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> aſſerts, <hi>What is ſworn muſt be ſo done as he that impoſed the Oath conceived muſt be done.</hi> And it was the obſervation of <hi>Tacitus, That they who ſwear timorouſly, craftily changing the words of their Oaths, had their Conſciences polluted with wickedneſs.</hi> Wherefore St. <hi>Auguſtine brands them with Perjury, who though they perform what is expreſt by the bare words of the Oath, do yet delude the expectation of thoſe to whom that Oath was given. But</hi> (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> well obſerves) <hi>though the words of the Oath be never ſo craftily penned, yet God, who is the Judge and Witneſs of the Conſcience, doth judge of it, as he to whom we ſwear underſtands it.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Metellus</hi> did wiſely, in refuſing to ſwear to the <hi>Apuleian</hi> Law, though he was told that that Law was unduly enacted, and that the Oath was not binding, unleſs the Law whereunto it referred, was rightly gained. For although in other Promiſes it be no hard matter to ſuppoſe ſome tacite condition, which if admitted, may abſolve the Promiſer; yet in Oaths, ſuch tacite conditions are by no means to be admitted, but if we do ſwear, we muſt <hi>liquido jurare, ſwear clearly and apertly:</hi> For <hi>ſuch an Oath for confirmation, is the end of all Controverſies;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and proves by the example of God himſelf: <hi>Who to ſhew to the Heirs of the Promiſe the immutability of his Counſels, confirmed it by his Oath, that by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, namely, his Promiſe and his Oath, wherein it is not poſſible that God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us</hi> (For ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

For that Divine Law that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to deſtroy the Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.33. being compared with another charge given by God, concerning them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.10. will admit of this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, That if they yielded upon the firſt ſummons, they might be received to mercy. As is clear by the Hiſtories of <hi>Rahab,</hi> who for ſecuring the Spies was ſaved:<note place="margin">Joſ. 16.10.</note> Of the Inhabitants of <hi>Gezer,</hi> who were ſuffered to live among the <hi>Ephramites,</hi> and to ſerve them: Of the <hi>Gergezites,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Matthew</hi> records,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.28.</note> that there were ſome living even until his time. Neither ſhall we find theſe ennumerated among thoſe that were to have been extirpated, as you may read <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 9.1. And laſtly, It is clear, by that Act of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.20, 21: whereby he is ſaid to have received the remainder of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> whom the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not deſtroy, as his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries and Bond-Servants unto that day. Yea, and if we examine the cauſe of that ſevere charge given unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for their extirpation, as it is expreſt <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4. we ſhall find that in caſe (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors obſerved) they would ſubmit to the Commandments given to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons, and pay Tribute, the cauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation being taken away, they might live.

And yet that the <hi>Gergezites</hi> being the Off-ſpring of the Inhabitants of <hi>Gezer,</hi> were ſpared and lived as Tributaries to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> till Chriſts time, is moſt evident by the Sacred ſtory. The immediate cauſe of the deſtruction of all the reſt of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> was not any inexorable Command given by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that left them a poſſibility to live, becauſe a power to ſubmit: But the <hi>hardneſs of their hearts, which,</hi> proceeded from God as a puniſhment for all their great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>that ſo, he might deſtroy them utterly, without any mercy, as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes.

                  <p>Neither ſhould the meaning of an Oath be wreſted to any other ſenſe, than the words do uſually bear. Wherefore, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having ſworn not to give their Daughters in Marriage to the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> did notwithſtanding ſuffer the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to take the Daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> by force, and to enjoy them, they were not guilty of Perjury. For it is one thing to give, and another, not to require what is already loſt. Whereof St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>This Indulgence of theirs was not without a Puniſhment ſuitable to their Intemperance, whileſt they were permitted only to enjoy thoſe whom they had raviſhed, without the ſolemnity of Marriage.</hi> Nec hortabantur Iſraelitae, nec prohibebant, ſaith <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph; The</hi> Iſraelites <hi>did neither encourage the</hi> Benjamites, <hi>nor forbid them.

                  <head>VI. Oaths bind not to things unlawful.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, That an Oath be binding, it is neceſſary that it refer to things lawful. For, if the thing promiſed upon Oath be forbidden either by the Law of Nature, or by the Divine Law, or interdicted by humane Laws, (whereof more anon) it hath no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49430:101"/> power at all to oblige us. That which is unlawful to be ſworn, is unlawful to be done being ſworn, and that which is unlawful for us to do, is unlawful to be ſworn. All Oaths have a tacite exception of the higher powers, and of former Oaths: Now God is greater than man, and therefore having firſt bound our ſelves unto him, no Oath made againſt him or againſt our duty to him, ought by us to be performed, but repented of. <hi>No Weapon formed againſt him ſhall proſper,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 54. It is good counſel that <hi>Philo</hi> gives in this caſe, <hi>Let him that goes about to do an unjuſt act by reaſon of his Oath, know, That he doth not thereby perform his Oath but break it. For an Oath is a ſacred thing, which deſerves our greateſt care and devotion, to preſerve; whereby we ſtand obliged to do ſuch things only, as are juſt and honeſt. For he doth but accumulate one ſin upon another, who to a wicked Oath, adds a diſhoneſt action. Wherefore let him that hath enſnared his own Soul by a raſh Vow, yet refrain from doing wickedly, That God who is rich in mercy may forgive him. For wilfully to contract a double guilt, when we may be diſcharged from a ſingle one, is an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable madneſs.</hi> Raſh Vows are ill made and ſometimes worſe kept. Our Tongues muſt not bind our hands to do wickedly.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> was leſs ſinful in breaking his Oath, and ſparing the life of <hi>Nabal,</hi> whom he had ſworn to kill, than <hi>Herod</hi> was in killing the Baptiſt, or <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in ſacrificing <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> for their Oaths ſake.

                  <p>The forms of Oaths may be different, but the ſubſtance of all are alike: For all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God as a Witneſs, or as an Avenger, both which in him are one and the ſame.

                  <p>And truly if the matter be ſuch, and the words ſo conceived, that they be referred not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, but unto Man, without doubt a Right will be gained to a man through that very Oath, even as by any promiſe or agreement, which ought to be underſtood in the moſt plain and ſimple way of Conſtruction. But if the words of the Oath do not refer to man by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Right to him, or if it do, yet ſuch a Right only as may be queſtioned; then ſuch is the force of an Oath, that though he to whom it is ſworn, cannot acquire that Right (becauſe the words will not clearly carry it) yet is he that ſwears obliged before God to make good his Oath. As for example, He that by ſome unjuſt terror or affright, ſhall extort a promiſe of ſomething; which promiſe binds with an Oath, though the Promiſer cannot thereby claim his Right to the thing promiſed; or if he do, is bound to reſtore it, becauſe he gave the occaſion of the damage unjuſtly: Yet as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Etiam vi extortum jusjurandum, ob Dei reverentiam ſervandum eſt: Even that Oath ſo extorted, ought for the reverence that we owe to the Name of God, to be carefully obſerved.</hi> We read that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſharply reproved by the Prophets and puniſhed by God himſelf, for not keeping their faith ſworn to the King of <hi>Babylon, Ezek.</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. and ſo by <hi>Jeremy, Jer.</hi> 29.7. And <hi>Cicero</hi> highly commends <hi>Pomponius</hi> the Tribune for obſerving his Oath, though wreſted from him by terror: <hi>Tantum temporibus illis jusjurandum valebat,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>So great was the reverence which in thoſe times was given unto Oaths.</hi> So that not only <hi>Regulus</hi> did well in rendring himſelf a Priſoner to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> but thoſe ten men alſo (recorded by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>) in returning to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by reaſon of their Oaths given in both caſes.</p>

                  <p>Neither is this practiſed among publick enemies only, but generally amongſt all: For it is not the quality of the perſons to whom we ſwear, but the fear and reverence of God whom we invoke, as a Witneſs and an Avenger of what we ſwear, that creates this Obligation. It was an error in <hi>Cicero</hi> to hold it no perjury, <hi>Si praedonibus pactum pro capite pretium non attuleris, nulla fraus eſt, ne ſi juratus id non feceris. de Offic. lib.</hi> 3. Though a man did not pay the mony, which he promiſed by Oath to Robbers for ſaving his life: Becauſe a Pyrate is not a particular enemy to this or that Nation, but a common enemy to all mankind, <hi>Cum quo nec fides eſſe debet, nec jusjurandum commune; With whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we ought not to keep either faith or common Oath.</hi> The very ſame he elſewhere ſaith of Tyrants, namely, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were not obliged by any Oaths or Promiſes they made to or with them: For though the difference be vaſt between an Enemy and a Pyrate, yet will not that difference much alter the caſe, where we have to do with God and not with men. And though the condition of the perſon be ſuch, as that he cannot claim a Right in what is ſo promiſed, yet to perform it being ſworn, is a duty that we owe to God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an Oath termed a <hi>Vow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Vow.</note> becauſe being made to God, we ſtand obliged before him to keep it. Neither can we grant what <hi>Cicero</hi> aſſerts, That there is no Society of Right with a Pyrate or Robber: For by the Law of Nations, whatſoever is depoſited with us by a Pyrate, ought to be reſtored to him, if the right owner of it doth not appear, as <hi>Triphonius</hi> rightly ſtates this Queſtion. Wherefore neither can we approve of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who think it ſufficient to lay down the ranſom which he hath ſworn to pay: So that it is lawful for him to take it away again, becauſe when we have to do with God, we ought to deal ſimply and ſincerely, ſo that it may have ſome effect. And better it is to bear a temporal loſs,<note place="margin">Vita Lyſand.</note> than to provoke God by the breach of our Vow: For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, <hi>Qui juramento hoſtem circumvenit, is oſtendit hoſtem a ſe metui, Deum contemni; He that circumvents an Enemy by a falſe Oath, plainly diſcovers that he fears his enemy, but deſpiſeth God.</hi> (Yet that what is ſo paid, may by a due courſe of Law be recovered, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

(Yet if a man do haply break his Faith with a Pyrate or a Robber, whether ſworn or unſworn, he ſhall thereby incur no penalty amongſt other Nations: For generally all Nations in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of theſe men, whom they account as common enemies to Humane Society, are pleaſed to connive at whatſoever is (though unjuſtly) done againſt them: For they that break the Communion and League that there is between all mankind, are common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and can have no right by the Law of Nations.)</p>

                     </q> If our promiſe made and confirmed by Oath, were manifeſtly grounded on ſome other promiſe, which was as a condition whereunto ours related, then that condition being not performed, makes void our promiſe though confirmed by Oath. But if the two promiſes were of ſeveral kinds, and did not mutually reſpect each other, then each promiſe is to be kept by him that ſware it, without any reſpect had to what the other doth. And hence it is, that <hi>Silius</hi> ſo highly extolls the Fact of <hi>Regulus,</hi> in that he kept his Faith with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had been ſo often known to break theirs with the <hi>Romans.</hi> A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt inequality in Contracts, doth naturally afford cauſe ſufficient either to reform or reſcind them, as I have already proved.

And this he may do two ways, either by way of puniſhment, or for a more publick good by vertue of his Soveraign power. And from hence we may learn what power Princes have over their Subjects Oaths, where he that ſwears, and he to whom it is ſworn, are of ſeveral Nations. But he that upon his Oath hath promiſed any thing, to a Nocent perſon, as to a Thief, or to a Pirate, as ſuch, cannot by way of puniſhment take away from him, that Right he hath given him: For then the words of his promiſe or of his Oath, ſhould have no effect at all, which inconvenience is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. For the like cauſe, the Right of that which is promiſed cannot be compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the Right of that which was before controverted, in caſe the agreement were made after that Controverſie began. Yet may an humane Law remove that impediment which it had put in acts of ſome certain kind, in caſe an Oath either of what kind ſoever, or in ſome certain form be added: As the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws have done, in ſuch impediments as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not the publick directly, but the private benefit of him that ſwears; which if it may be done, the act ſworn ſhall ſtand in force in the ſame manner as naturally it would, if ſuch an humane Law were not, either in obliging hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> is honeſt and faithful, urge him not to ſwear; but if thou ſuſpect him for a lyar, urge him not to forſwear. The <hi>Scythians</hi> in <hi>Curtius</hi> told <hi>Alexander, That it was not the cuſtom of the Scythians,</hi> Gratiam jurando ſancire, <hi>to purchaſe his favour or eſtabliſh their own peace by Oaths. For,</hi> ſaith <hi>Curtius,</hi> Colendo Fidem, Scythae jurant; <hi>The</hi> Scythians <hi>are ſo great admirers of truth and Fidelity, that their bare words do oblige them as firmly as (and their deeds confirm their promiſes, more than) their Oaths. Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Roſcius Comoedus</hi> tells us, <hi>that look what puniſhments the Gods awarded to a perjured perſon, the ſame they awarded to a Lyer. For it was not the form of words, wherein the Oath was comprehended, that provoked the Gods unto vengeance; but the malice and perfidiouſneſs of the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Treacheries and forgeries are minted.</hi> It is excellent Counſel that <hi>Solon</hi> gives us, <hi>That we ſhould have ſo great a regard to our own honeſty, that our words may be as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative and convincing as our Oaths.</hi> Thus <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> deſcribes a juſt man, <hi>to be one, that evidenceth the truth of his promiſes, by the ſincerity and conſtant ſtability of his words and actions. Cicero</hi> records it of a certain Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> that being known to be of a Religious, and upright converſation;<note place="margin">Orat. pro Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> and being to give his publick teſtimony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, was not permitted ſo to do; but as he approached near the Altar to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all the Judges with one voice cryed out, That he ſhould not ſwear, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give more credit to his Oath, than to his word. Very pertinent to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour where he ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> is that ſaying of <hi>Hierocles, He that in the beginning ſaid, Thou ſhalt reverence an Oath; did therein enjoyn us to abſtain from ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concering ſuch thing as are contingent, and of uncertain events. For ſuch things are ſo mutable, and of ſo ſmall an account, that they are not worth an Oath, neither is it ſafe to ſwear about them.</hi> And <hi>Libanius</hi> inſerts this amongſt many other Vertues, for which he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extols a Chriſtian Emperor, <hi>That he was ſo far from Perjury, that he feared to ſwear to what he knew to be truth; A perjurio tantum abeſt, ut etiam vera jurare vereatur.</hi>

                  <head>I. Whether Kings may reſcind their own Acts.</head>
                  <p>THe Promiſes, Contracts, and Oaths of Kings, and of ſuch others as have the like Soveraign power, have ſome queſtions peculiar to themſelves, as well concerning what power they have over their own Acts, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they have over their Subjects, as that which they have over their Succeſſors. As to the firſt of theſe, it is queſtioned, Whether the King himſelf hath the ſame power to reſtore himſelf to the full, or to make void his own Contracts, or to abſolve himſelf from his Oath, as he hath, his Subjects. <hi>Bodine</hi> was of opinion that a King being circumvented by another mans fraud, by fear or error, may for the ſame cauſes be reſtored to his own Rights, as well in things appertaining to the leſſening of his Prerogative as a King, or in things appertaining to his private Eſtate, as his Subjects may. Whereunto he addes, That a King is not bound by his Oath, if the Contract agreed on be ſuch, as by the Civil Law may be revoked, although the Contracts be agreeable to honeſty. And that a King is not therefore bound, becauſe he hath ſworn; but as every man may be bound by ſuch juſt covenants, ſo far as it concerns the other Party. But we, as we have elſewhere diſtinguiſhed, ſo do we here, between the acts of Kings which they do as Kings, and the private acts of the ſame Kings. For what they do as Kings in their politick Capacity, is ſo eſteemed, as done by the conſent of the whole Nation: But over ſuch acts, as the Laws made by the whole body of the people could have no power, becauſe the Community cannot be ſuperiour to it ſelf; ſo neither can the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws of a King null his own publick acts; becauſe a King cannot be Superiour to himſelf. Wherefore reſtitution which receives its vigor from the Civil Law only, is of no force againſt ſuch Contracts. Neither are thoſe Contracts to be exempted which Kings make in their Minority.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>II. To what Acts of Kings the Laws extend.</head>
                  <p>Without all queſtion, if the people elect a King, yet not with full and abſolute Right, but reſtrain him with ſome Laws; then what acts he ſhall do contrary to thoſe Laws, may by thoſe Laws be made null, either altogether, or in part, becauſe the people did reſerve that Right unto themſelves. But if the King do Reign in full Right, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not bounded by any Law, yet holds not his Kingdom in propriety, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> hath no power to alienate it, or any part of it, or of its Revenues: all ſuch acts of his that ſhall tend to ſuch an alienation, are by the Law of Nature void, becauſe what he ſo alienates, is not his own. But the private acts of a King, are to be conſidered, not as the acts of the Community, but as the acts of a Part, and are therefore made with a purpoſe, that they may follow the common rule of the Laws. Whence it is that even the Laws, which make void ſome acts either ſimply, or if the perſon damnified will, ſhall take place even here alſo, as if it had been contracted upon this condition: So we have ſeen ſome Kings, who have conſulted the Laws for remedies againſt extortion. Yet may a King, if he pleaſe, exempt from thoſe Laws, his own acts as well as other mens: but whether he will ſo do, or not, muſt be gathered from Circumſtances. If he do, then ſhall the mere Law of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49430:104"/> Nature determine the caſe; yet with this Proviſo, That where the Laws do make void any private mans act, not in favour to the perſon acting, but as his puniſhment; thoſe Laws are of no force againſt the acts of Kings, nor indeed, any other Penal Laws, nor any thing elſe that implies <hi>vim cogendi,</hi> a power Coercive. For to puniſh and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, cannot proceed but from two different and diſtinct wills, and ſo from diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; neither can the compeller, and the compelled, be any one perſon, though under diverſe reſpects.</p>

                  <head>III. When Kings are bound by their Oaths, and when not.</head>
                  <p>A King may make void his own Oath, as a private man, <hi>antecedenter, i. e.</hi> If by a former Oath, he hath deprived himſelf of the power to oblige himſelf by Oath, to any ſuch thing: but conſequently he cannot, for herein alſo is required a diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Beſides, to every ſuch abſolution it is requiſite, that in the very Oath before taken there ſhould have been this limitation or exception (either expreſt or implied) <hi>Niſi ſuperior volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs my Prince comand the contrary:</hi> Which in the Oath of a King cannot be admitted, becauſe this were to make a King ſuperior to himſelf, or to make his Oath ſtill to depend upon his own will, which is contrary to the nature of an Oath. And whereas an Oath, though made, may confer no Right to another, by reaſon of ſome default in that perſon; yet is he that ſweareth, bound before God, to make good what he hath ſo promiſed, as is before ſaid. And thus alſo are Kings bound by their Oaths, which they make, no leſs than private men: though <hi>Bodinus</hi> thought otherwiſe.</p>

                  <p>We have likewiſe already ſhewed, That full and abſolute Promiſes being accepted of, do naturally transfer our Right to another. Now this holds as well in Kings as in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men.

                  <head>V. Of what uſe that which hath been ſaid of the power of the Law about the Contracts of Kings.</head>
                  <p>That the Civil Laws of a Kingdom have no power over the Covenants and Contracts of a King, is well acknowledged by <hi>Vaſquius.</hi> But that which he would thence infer, namely, that what is by him bought or ſold for no price certain, or what is by him let or taken to hire without any Rent agreed on; or what he ſhall give away in Fee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Writing or Grant under his hand, ſhall be of force, we cannot admit: For theſe acts are done by him, not as a King, but as any private perſon; and over ſuch acts as theſe, not only the Civil Laws of that Nation, but even the Municipal Laws of that City wherein the King reſides, have power: becauſe the King for ſome ſpecial reaſon placeth himſelf there as a Member of that Corporation, unleſs it ſhall appear by good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that it was his will, that thoſe acts of his ſhould be exempted from the power of thoſe Laws. But that other example brought by the ſame <hi>Vaſquius,</hi> concerning a promiſe any way made, doth very well agree, and may be explained by what hath been before ſaid.</p>

                  <p>That which Civilians do generally affirm, that the Covenants which a King entreth into with his Subjects, do oblige by the Law of Nature only, and not by the Civil Law, is ſomewhat obſcure. For that is ſometimes corruptly ſaid by the Law-givers, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to oblige, which is only agreeable to the rules of honeſty, but yet cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be due: As for an Executor to pay the entire Legacies without Defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though he have not the fourth part of the Teſtators Eſtate left him; or to pay a juſt Debt, though the Creditor be made by the Law uncapable of receiving it; or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite a Courteſie received: all which can no ways be recovered by any action at Law. Sometimes again, That is more properly ſaid naturally to oblige, which is indeed truly obligatory, whether it be ſuch as transfers a Right unto another as in Contracts; or ſuch as transfers none, as in a full and firm Pollicitation. <hi>Maimonides</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> doth very apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh between theſe three: Whatſoever cometh more than is due, falls under the notion of mercy, which is but the overflowings of a good nature,<note place="margin">Mercy, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteouſneſs diſtinguiſht.</note> ſuch are good works done meerly out of bounty and munificence. Secondly, To perform what we are ſtrictly bound to do, which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call judgment; but to do that which in honeſty and Conſcience only we ought to do, this they call Righteouſneſs or Equity. Which three ſome Expoſitors upon that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. render by mercy, judgment, and fidelity, whereby the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Greeks do commonly underſtand Righteouſneſs; and by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, judgment, that which we are ſtrictly obliged to do, as we may find, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 7.18, &amp; 32. Moreover a man may be ſaid to be civilly obliged by his own act, either in this ſenſe, that the Obligation ſpring not from the mere Right of Nature, but from a Civil Right, or from both; or in ſuch a ſenſe, as that an action at the Civil Law may lie againſt him. We conclude therefore, that from the Covenants and Promiſes which a King makes with his people, there may ariſe ſuch a true and proper Obligation, as may confer a Right unto them: For ſuch is the Nature both of Promiſes and Contracts, even between God and Men, as we have ſhewed already. If the acts of a King be ſuch as may be done by any other man, the Civil Laws ſhall bind him; but if they be ſuch as are done by him merely as a King, the Civil Laws do not reach him, which difference was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49430:105"/> not by <hi>Vaſquius</hi> ſufficiently obſerved. Nevertheleſs an action may ariſe from either of theſe acts, ſo far forth as to evidence the Right of the Creditor; but no enforcement there can be, by reaſon of the quality or condition of the adverſe party. For that Subjects ſhould compel him whoſe Subjects they are, is not lawful, which Equals may do againſt Equals by the Right of nature, and Superiours againſt Inferiours by the Civil Laws.</p>

                  <p>But this alſo muſt be noted, that a King may take away the Right of his Subjects two ways, either by way of puniſhment, or by Vertue of his Soveraign Power. But if he do it this latter way, it muſt be (in the firſt place) for ſome publick profit, and then alſo the Subject muſt receive, if it be poſſible, a juſt ſatisfaction out of the Common ſtock for the loſs he ſhall ſuſtain; this therefore as it holds in other things, ſo alſo in that Right, that is gained, by either Promiſe or Contract.</p>

                  <p>Neither doth it make any alteration in the caſe, whether the Right of the Subject were acquired by the Law of Nature, or by the Civil Law. For the King hath an equal Right to both, nor can either of them be taken away from the Subject without cauſe. For it is againſt natural Right that what Dominion or other Right a man hath lawfully gained to himſelf, he ſhould be cauſeleſly deprived of. And if a King ſhould do it, he ought without doubt to make reſtitution, and to repair the damage that the Subject hath ſuſtained, becauſe he doth thereby violate the true Right of his Subject. And herein is the Right of Strangers much different from that of Subjects; for the Right of Strangers, and of ſuch as in no reſpect are Subjects, can by no means be under that ſupereminent Dominion of a King; as the Rights of Subjects are for the publick good: unleſs by way of Puniſhment, whereof hereafter.</p>

                  <p>From whence we may collect, upon how ſandy a Foundation they build, who hold all the Contracts of Kings to be Laws. For from the Laws there ariſeth no Right againſt a King to any man. Therefore if the King ſhould think fit to repeal thoſe Laws, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to injure any man: Yet if he do it without good cauſe, he gives juſt cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But from Promiſes and Contracts a man may claim a Right. For by Contracts the Contractors only are bound; but by the Laws, all that are Subjects. Yet may ſome things be of a mixt nature: Partly by Contracts, and partly by the Laws, as when a King contracts with a Neighbour King, or with Farmers of his Revenues, which he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaims a Law, ſo far forth as it contains what is by his Subjects to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>

                  <p>Let us now proceed to the Succeſſors, concerning whom we are to diſtinguiſh between thoſe that are to inherit all the goods of the deceaſed King together with his Kingdom; as he that receives a Patrimonial Kingdom, either by his Teſtament, or from an Inteſtate: and between thoſe that ſucceed in the Kingdom only, either by a new Election, or by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; and that either in imitation of other vulgar inheritances, or otherwiſe; or whether they ſucceed by any mixt Right. For they that inherit all the goods, with the Kingdom, are without doubt obliged to perform all the Contracts and Promiſes of the deceaſed King. And that the goods of the deceaſed ſhould ſtand obliged for his perſonal Debts, is as ancient as Dominion it ſelf.</p>

               <div n="11" type="section">
                  <head>XI. And how his Succeſſors.</head>
                  <p>But how far they that ſucceed to the Kingdom only, or to the goods in part, but to the Kingdom entirely, are obliged by the Covenants and Contracts of their Predeceſſors, is as worthy to be diſcuſt, as it hath hitherto been confuſedly handled. They that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Kingdom but not as Heirs, are not immediately bound by the Covenants and Contracts of their Predeceſſors; becauſe the Title they have, they receive not from him but from the people; whether that Succeſſion fall like other vulgar inheritances, to him that is neareſt of kinn to the deceaſed, or to thoſe that are more remote. But mediately <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the City that choſe him, ſuch Succeſſors alſo are bound: which ſhall be thus underſtood. Every Society, no leſs than every particular perſon hath a power to oblige it ſelf, either by it ſelf, or by its Major part. This Right every Society may transfer, either expreſly, or by neceſſary conſequence, that is, by transferring the Empire: for in Morals he that gives the end, gives all things conducing to the end.</p>

                  <p>And yet ſhould not this be boundleſs; neither is it at all neceſſary to the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Nation, that this obliging power ſhould be infinite, no more than that of a Guardian is, but ſo far forth only as the Nature of that power requires. <hi>Tutor Domini loco habetur, cum rem adminiſtrat, non cum pupillum ſpoliat; The Guardian</hi> (ſaith <hi>Julian) hath a power equal to the Lord, whileſt he orders the eſtate prudently, but not, when he waſtes it.</hi> And in this ſenſe is that of <hi>

For to reduce a Prince to ſuch ſtraits would be dangerous to the Commonwealth. Neither is it likely, that when the people transferr'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49430:105"/> upon him, they intended ſo to retain him. But what the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors anſwered in the cauſe of their City, That what was transferred by the Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">☜</note> ſhould be of force in doubtful matters, but not, when that which is clearly due to the City is raſhly given away or forgiven; the ſame anſwer may and ought to be given to this queſtion, in the behalf of the whole body of the people, obſerving a due proportion. For, as it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Law that obligeth Subjects; for beſides thoſe which command things unlawful, ſome Laws are evidently abſurd, and fooliſh, as that Law of <hi>Cabades</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> recorded by <hi>Procopius,</hi> and <hi>Agathias.</hi> Neither is it congruous to reaſon, (as <hi>Peter</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>Juſtine</hi> the Second, told <hi>Coſroes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> treating about ſome things, which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſeemed long before to promiſe to the <hi>Saracens, That a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould forever be condemned, for one ſimple Law or cuſtome introduced, or enacted by one man, although an Emperor.</hi> So alſo the Contracts of Princes do bind their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, if they have any probable reaſon to juſtifie them, which in doubtful caſes ought to be preſumed, in reſpect of the wiſdom, and authority of thoſe that made them. And it is much ſafer thus to diſtinguiſh of them, than (as ſome do) by the greater or leſſer damage, that ariſeth to the Commonwealth by them. For we are not ſo much to regard the event of ſuch Contracts, as the reaſons whereupon they were grounded; which if probable the people ſhall be bound by them, if by any accident they ſhall begin to a be free people; and ſo ſhall they that are Succeſſors as being for the time, the heads of the people: For if the people being free, ſhall make any Contract or agreement, their Kings that ſhall afterwards Reign, ſhall thereby be bound, although he receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the fulleſt Right. The Emperor <hi>Titus</hi> is highly commended for this, That he would not endure to be ſollicited to confirm any thing that his Predeceſſors had granted, thinking it but reaſonable, That if he expected that his Succeſſors ſhould be bound by his acts, he alſo ſhould be obliged by the acts of their Predeceſſors:<note place="margin">

That excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Emperor <hi>Nerva,</hi> following the example of <hi>Titus,</hi> in that Edict recorded by <hi>Pliny,</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Let not any man conceive, That what he hath got from any of my Predeceſſors ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privately, or publickly, ſhall by me be ſo far reſcinded, as that they ſhall be indebted to me though but to confirm it, neither ſhall they need any mans Interceſſion to obtain it.</hi> But when <hi>Tacitus</hi> had declared, how <hi>Vitellius</hi> had torn the Empire in pieces, without any regard had to Poſterity, (the Common people flocking about him,<note place="margin">But not of prodigal Princes.</note> and courting him for his profuſe gifts; and ſome others hoping for a good purchaſe, tempting him with ready money) at length adds this, <hi>Apud ſapientes, caſſa habebantur, qua neque dari neque accipi, ſalva republica poterant; That ſuch gifts were always by wiſe men accounted void, which could neither be given, nor received without endangering the Commonwealth.</hi> Which very ſaying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> is much commended by <hi>Mariana,</hi> and applyed to the vaſt and unbounded Beneficence of <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who gave away, as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> relates, not his own Crown Lands only, but other mens alſo, according as his fancy led him. The ſame may very fitly be applyed to the queſtion in hand, and therefore <hi>Galba</hi> made no ſcruple of revoking the Grants of <hi>Nero,</hi> even from thoſe that had purchaſed them, leaving the Tenth part only unto them: as <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifie. So did <hi>Baſilius</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Emperor, recover all that the Emperor <hi>Michael</hi> had given away. Whereof <hi>Zonaras</hi> thus: That it was unanimouſly agreed, that They that had received moneys without any probable cauſe, ſhould reſtore it, ſome wholly, and others one half. The like did <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth of <hi>France,</hi> revoke all that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh had prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, given not excepting his Donatives to the Church: As <hi>Commineus</hi> teſtifies.<note place="margin">Comines lib. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> This alſo may here be added, if any ſuch accident fall out wherein a Contract made by a King is diſcovered to be not only damagable, but pernitious to the Commonwealth, ſo that at the time, when the ſaid Contract was ſo made, had it been applyed to that caſe, it had been judged unlawful and unjuſt; Then may that Contract be not ſo much revoked, as declared to be no longer binding, as if made with condition, of being void in that caſe, without which condition it could not have been juſtly made. Thus did that wiſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> revoke ſome priviledges granted to the <hi>Hans-Towns,</hi>

Anno. <hi>1595, 1597.</hi> in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Hanſiatica.</note> by her Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, when they began to exact them as due by rigour of Law, and not as granted them by the meer favour of the Prince: Alledging that priviledges granted by Princes to their ſubjects, much more to ſtrangers, might according to the times for the benefit of the Commonwealth and other cauſes be lawfully ſuſpended, yea revoked and made void. And when the ſame Queen had drawn a dangerous War upon her ſelf, for aſſiſting the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who refuſed to repay her thoſe vaſt ſums expended for their ten years defence, upon pretence that by her Contract with them, that money was not due till the War was ended, and that till then ſhe could not recede from her contract: She prudently replyed, That all Contracts between Princes, were to be underſtood to admit of an interpretation of ſincere fidelity. Neither is any Prince bound by his Contracts, when for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49430:106"/> juſt cauſe that Contract turneth to the publick Detriment. That the peace is not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, though a Prince recede from his Contract, when it is done by an accident of a new caſe, or when it comes to a new caſe, which had it been thought on had otherwiſe been provided againſt. Laſtly, That a Prince is not bound by any Contract though ſolemnly made, if it tend to the Detriment of the Commonwealth: For that a Prince is more ſtrongly bound to the Commonwealth,<note place="margin">Vide Camd. Eliz. <hi>1595, 1597.</hi>
                     </note> than to his own Promiſe, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> records. And what is here ſaid of Contracts is true alſo in the Alienation of the peoples money, and of any other things, which the King hath by Law a power to alienate, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. For herein alſo is this diſtinction to be obſerved, where there is any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon for giving, or otherwiſe alienating what is the peoples. But in caſe the King ſhall by any Contract go about to alienate any part of his Kingdom, or of the Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, beyond what is permitted unto him, ſuch a Contract ſhall be of no force, as being made of that which was not his to diſpoſe of. As much may be ſaid of ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as are limited and reſtrained, if the people have exempted any, either matter or kind of acts from the power of their King. For to make ſuch acts valid, the conſent of the people, or their Repreſentatives, is neceſſarily required; as we have already ſhewed when we diſcourſt of alienations. Now theſe diſtinctions being obſerved, it is no difficult matter to judge, Whether the exceptions of Kings who refuſe to pay their Predeceſſors Debts, whoſe Heirs they are not, be juſt or unjuſt; whereof we may read many examples in <hi>Bodine.</hi>

                  <p>Neither is that which ſome affirm, to be admitted without a diſtinction, namely, that the benefits of Princes which are freely and liberally granted, may at any time be revoked. For ſome benefits, a King may give out of what is his own; and which were it not for this clauſe, at the prayer or requeſt of the Grant, might well paſs for a perfect Donative. Now theſe cannot be revoked unleſs from Subjects by way of puniſhment, or for publick good, for which alſo ſatisfaction muſt be given out of the publick ſtock, if poſſible. But other benefits there are which only take away the binding power of the Law, without any Contract; and theſe are revocable. For as a Law univerſally taken away, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be univerſally reſtored; ſo alſo being particularly taken away, it may be particularly reſtored.

                  <p>The difference between Leagues and Sponſions we may learn out of the ninth Book of <hi>Livy,</hi> where he tells us, That Leagues are ſuch agreements as are made by the Command of the Supreme power, and whereby the whole Nation is made liable to the wrath of God, if they infringe it. And this among the <hi>Romans</hi> was wont to be performed by Heraulds in the preſence of the King of the Heraulds: But a Sponſion is where the Generals having no order from the Supreme Power to conclude any thing about ſuch a matter, do yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and undertake ſomething concerning it. In <hi>Saluſt</hi> we read thus, <hi>The Senate (as it is very fit) have decreed, That without their, and the peoples Command, no League ſhall be made.</hi>

The Second is, When both parties being of equal power and ſucceſs in the War, do agree in an amicable League on equal conditions. And then by agreement, things taken are on either ſide to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: And in caſe any man hath been diſturb'd in his poſſeſſions during the War, the difference is to be compoſed, either according to ancient Right, or according to the mutual Profit and Convenience of both parties. The Third is, When they that never were Enemies do enter into a Social League between themſelves, without either giving or receiving Laws on either ſide.</p>

                  <p>But we are to diſtinguiſh ſomewhat more accurately: As, in the firſt place, we may ſay that ſome Leagues require ſuch things only as are congruous to the Law of Nature, others add ſomething thereunto. Leagues of the former kind are uſually made, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between Enemies at the end of a War, but of old, were both often made, and in ſome ſort neceſſary amongſt thoſe who before had never contracted for any thing. The ground whereof was, That that Principle of Natural Right, (which inſtructed us, that Nature had prudently linked together all mankind in a kind of ſtrict Alliance: And therefore for one man to hurt another was impiety) was, as of old before the flood, ſo again ſome times after, by an univerſal corruption of manners ſo obliterated, that it was held lawful to rob and ſpoil Foreigners; yea, though there were no Wars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.<note place="margin">No ſin to rob ſtrangers.</note> So <hi>Caeſar</hi> of the <hi>Germans, Latrocinia nullam habent Infamiam, quae extra fines cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſque civitatis fiunt; Look what Spoil and Robberies they committed without the bounds of their City,</hi>

                     <hi>they held as no diſhonour</hi> The like Teſtimony <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives of them, with whom agrees that of <hi>Plutarch</hi> touching the <hi>Spaniards, Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>till that time thought it an honourable imployment to ſpoil and plunder out of their own Territories:</hi> Nay, the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves refuſed to make ſatisfaction for damages done, unleſs to a <hi>Jew</hi> or a Confederate. whence that queſtion in <hi>Homer (An Praedones eſtis? Are ye Forragers (i. e.)</hi> ſuch as live by the ſpoils of ſtrangers) was an innocent and friendly Interrogation: For, ſaith the Scholiaſt upon that place, <hi>To prey upon ſtrangers was then held an honourable imployment.</hi> The very ſame we find in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> with this addition, <hi>For this kind of life was not at that time infamous, but commendable.</hi> No more was Pyracy upon the Seas until the Reign of <hi>Tarquine,</hi> as <hi>Juſtin</hi> teſtifies. And this the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws ſeem to juſtifie. For if any thing had been taken by the <hi>Romans</hi> from any Nation with whom they had no commerce, hoſpitality, nor League of Amity, (for theſe were not accounted enemies) it was held by them as lawful prize: So if a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen were found among them, or brought unto them they were immediately made Slaves. And in this caſe did their Law of Poſtlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny take place: The ſame and no better quarter had thoſe people being taken by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thus we read that the <hi>Corcyrenſes</hi> before the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, were no Enemies to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but neither had they Peace with them nor any Truce, as by the Oration of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in <hi>Thucydides</hi> appears. So <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſpeaks concerning <hi>Bocchus, Nobis nec pace nec bello cognitus; That he was altogether unknown to the</hi> Romans <hi>by either Peace or War.</hi> And to rob and ſpoil ſuch, was, in the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> laudable: And is ſo far warrantable by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws,<note place="margin">

Now both theſe kinds of Leagues are made either for Peace or for Society ſake. Thoſe equal Leagues of Peace are uſually made for the reſtitution of Priſoners or Goods taken in War, or for mutual ſecurity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhall ſpeak more at large anon, when we have occaſion to ſpeak of the effects and conſequences of War. Thoſe equal Leagues of Society reſpect either mutual commerce, or an equal participating of the charge of a War, or ſome other matters. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Commerce, equal Covenants may be various, as namely, That no Cuſtoms be paid on either ſide, which we find to be one of the Articles agreed on in that ancient League made between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> except only what was given to the Notary and to the Cryer: Or that no more ſhould be exacted than what was at preſent paid, or not beyond ſuch a rate. So alſo in a Social War, That each party ſhould contribute a like number of Foot or Horſe or Ships, and that, either againſt all Nations, and in all Wars, whether offenſive or defenſive, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as having the ſame both Friends and Enemies; Examples whereof we often read in <hi>Livy:</hi> Or for the defence of their own bounds only, or limited to ſuch a War only as is expreſt, or againſt ſuch an enemy, or againſt all except their Allies, as in the League concluded between the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Macodonians,</hi> recorded by <hi>Polybius:</hi> Or as the <hi>Rhodians</hi> covenanted with <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> againſt all Enemies whatſoever, <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> only excepted. The like equal Leagues may be made, in reſpect of other things: As, That neither party ſhould build any more Forts, confining on the Borders of the others Territories; or that neither of them ſhall protect the others Subjects; or that neither of them ſhall permit the others Enemies to march through their Countreys.</p>

                  <p>By what hath been ſaid of Leagues that are equal, we may eaſily diſcover what is meant by ſuch as are unequal. Which inequality may reſpect either the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful party, or that which is weaker: From the ſtronger, as, when ſuccours are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but none required, or when more is granted, than is exacted. From the weaker, as when harder conditions are impoſed on them than are juſt, and theſe we call Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: And of theſe, ſome tend to the weakening of the Empire, as in the ſecond League made between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> wherein it was provided, That the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> ſhould make no War without leave from the <hi>Romans.</hi> And from that time were the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by that League, little better than Servants to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And to this alſo we may refer thoſe conditional ſurrenders, ſaving that this is not ſo properly a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire, as a full tranſlation of it to another. Yet is ſuch an Agreement ſometimes ſweetned with the name of a League, as <hi>Livy</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The</hi> Teates <hi>in</hi> Apulia <hi>made ſuit to the</hi> Romans, <hi>That they might enter into a League with them, not upon equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but that they might be under the dominion of the</hi> Romans. Some again tend not to the undermining of the Empire, but only impoſe grievous burthens upon the weaker party, and that either for a certain time only, or for continuance. For a certain time, as the defraying the charge of the War, the demoliſhing of their Walls, the quitting of certain places of ſtrength; Or to give Hoſtages to deliver ſo many Elephants, Ships, or the like. Others are permanent, as, That they bear all reverence to the Majeſty and Empire of the other party, which how far it extends, we have elſewhere ſhewed.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. §. 21.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining upon this is, That they account thoſe as Friends or Enemies which the other party declares to be ſo; alſo, that they permit no Army free paſſage through their dominions that are the others Enemies. There are alſo ſome lighter burthens ſometimes laid upon them, as, That they ſhall not raiſe any Fort, nor build any City, nor lead an Army, nor traffick by Servants to ſuch and ſuch places, That they ſhall not keep above
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49430:108"/> ſuch a number of Ships, That they ſhall make no War with ſuch a people being Aſſociates with the other party, That they ſhall not ſupply the others enemies with any manner of proviſions, nor receive them though they come from other places; That they ſhall break their League, though formerly made with ſuch a people: For examples of all theſe we find very frequently in the beſt Hiſtorians. Moreover, unequal Leagues are often made, not only between the Conquerors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Conquered, as <hi>Menippus</hi> conceited; but alſo between people of unequal power, yea, amongſt thoſe Nations that never were at War againſt each other.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 31.44.</note>.

Neither did the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> change any thing herein. But we find a ſtrict prohibition given to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> That they ſhould not treat with them as enemies, and yet without doubt they were Idolaters.<note place="margin">Deut. 23.7. <hi>Joſhua</hi> might not make a League with the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had declared his purpoſe to caſt them out. 2 Sam. 5.11. 1 Kings 5.12.</note> But here we muſt beware, that we draw not the ſeven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God had decreed to caſt out of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their Idolatry, into a precedent, and from their and the <hi>Amalekites</hi> examples, create a general rule.

And as to the League of Commerce, either for mutual, or either parties advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that ſuch might be made with Heatheniſh people, we may ſafely conclude from thoſe made by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> with King <hi>Hiram:</hi> Where this is worthy our obſervation, That it is ſaid in Holy Writ, <hi>That this League was ſo made according to the wiſdom that God had given him.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> being perſecuted by <hi>Saul</hi> fled to <hi>Achis,</hi> nor was he ever reproved for ſo doing. 'Tis true, that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth every where command them to do good to their Countrey-men, and ſpecial care is taken to preſerve them in love one with another: And as true it is, that their very diet, and the whole manner of their lives was ſuch, that it would not ſuffer them to have any familiarity with ſtrangers. For as <hi>Juvenal</hi> obſerves, They were ſo moroſe, that they would not direct a ſtranger in his way; that is, they would not do a ſtranger the leaſt of courteſies, though they might do it without the ſmalleſt pains or charge:

But yet ſuch were the corrupt Gloſſes of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they perſwaded the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if they performed thoſe duties of Juſtice and Charity to thoſe of their own Nation, they had ſufficiently fulfilled the Law; though to all others they were not uncivil only, but barbarous, as indeed they were. For we find it recorded of them by the Evangeliſt, that it was not their cuſtome to eat, to drink, or to have any familiarity with Strangers. And thus through all Ages they have continued, as appears by the Characters given of them by all Hiſtorians. <hi>Apollonius Molo</hi> objects againſt them thus, <hi>They admit of none amongſt them, that agree not with them in matters of Religion, neither will they communicate with them in any thing.</hi> Thus do the Friends of <hi>Antiochus</hi> in <hi>Diodorus</hi> brand them, <hi>A people they are of all others the moſt unſociable to ſtrangers; for they account all ſuch as enemies:</hi> And a little after, <hi>They will not eat with any other people, nor ſo much as ſalute or bid them farewel; ſuch a general hatred they bear to all mankind.</hi> The like teſtimony doth <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> give of them: And in <hi>Joſephus</hi> we find it every where objected againſt them, That they were a <hi>people of all others the moſt uncivil, and the moſt unſociable.</hi> But Chriſt, who was every where moſt obſervant of the Law, did by his own example teach them, that this was not

                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeek their proſperity nor their good all thy dayes for ever.</hi> In which words the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are forbidden to make any League of ſociety or amity with them; yet it gives them no right to make war againſt them. Or haply this place of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> may be better underſtood, according to the opinion of ſome of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, as if to ſeek a peace from them were forbidden, but not to accept thereof, when offered. Certain it is, they were forbidden to make War upon the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,<note place="margin">Judg. 11.16.</note> Deut.</hi> 2.19. neither did <hi>Jephtha</hi> accept it till they had obſtinately refuſed equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace; nor <hi>David</hi> till he was provoked thereunto by unſufferable injuries. The Queſtion then reſteth here,<note place="margin">Whether we may joyn with Infidels in a Social War.</note> Whether it be lawful to enter into a Social War with Infidels? Before the Law given, that this was not unlawful, appears by the practice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who aſſiſted the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> in their War. Neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> change any thing herein, that we can read. Of the ſame perſwaſion were the <hi>Aſmonaeans,</hi> who were both very skilful in the Law, and very ſtrict obſervers of it, witneſs their religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath, whereon notwithſtanding they made uſe of their Arms to defend themſelves, but not otherwiſe: and yet we find them entring into Confederacy with the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> by the conſent both of Prieſts and people; and inſtituting ſolemn Sacrifices for their ſafety. Theſe <hi>Aſmonaeans,</hi> we find highly commended in the <hi>Chaldee Targum,</hi> in the Books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whoſe example both Emperours and Chriſtian Kings following, made Leagues with ſuch as were either not at all Chriſtians, or at leaſt not ſound Chriſtians: as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Juſtinian</hi> with the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the <hi>Francks,</hi> the <hi>Scythians.</hi> So did <hi>Theodoſius, Honorius, Leo, Heracleus, Baſilius, Iſacius</hi> and others with the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the <hi>Moors.</hi> Now the examples that are brought out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the defence of the contrary opinion, have cauſes peculiar to themſelves. For certainly ſome Kings and people there were (beſide thoſe forbidden by the Law) who were ſo wicked, that God by his Prophets declared his purpoſe to deſtroy them; now to joyn in Confederacy with theſe, was doubtleſs unlawful. Thus did the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> for joyning in League with <hi>Ahab;</hi> yea, and ſeems to threaten him for it, <hi>Shouldſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 19.2.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi> For the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> had before told the unhappy ſucceſs of that War. So did another Prophet reprove <hi>Amaſia,</hi> for waging a War with an Army hired out of <hi>Iſrael, Let not the Army of Iſrael go with thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 25.7.</note> 
                     <hi>for the Lord is not with them</hi> But this was not by reaſon of the unlawfulneſs of the League, but by reaſon of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſons; as may be evinced by this, that God did ſharply rebuke and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> for aſſociating himſelf with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though it were but for traffick. And yet when <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> did the like with <hi>Hiram,</hi> God did not only not reprove, but in part commend them for it:<note place="margin">Conſtit. Clem. lib. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> For in that <hi>Ahaziah</hi> is ſaid to do very wickedly, it is to be underſtood of the whole courſe of his life, which was aggravated, in that being an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> he had forſaken the God of his Fathers; and therefore was God provoked to blaſt all his enterpriſes. For this alſo is to be obſerved, That the caſe of thoſe, who being <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> forſook the Lord whom they knew,<note place="margin">Eſay 8.6. 1 Chr. 16.12. <hi>Ambr. ad Rom.</hi> 3.</note> was far worſe than of thoſe that were ſtrangers. For againſt thoſe that made this defection, the reſt of the people might take Arms, and deſtroy them and all they had, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.13. Sometimes again where the Leagues are blamed, it is not for the Leagues ſake, but for the wicked intention of him that makes it: So God reproves <hi>Aſa,</hi> for betaking himſelf to the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> namely, out of diffidence; which he had declared by ſending the Veſſels conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God unto the <hi>Syrian.</hi> So when he was ſick,<note place="margin">1 Chr. 16.12.</note> he placed more confidence in his Phyſician, than in God; whereby we can no more conclude, that it is generally and of it ſelf unlawful to make a League with ſuch as this <hi>Syrian</hi> was, than it would be to conſult a Phyſician about a mans health. <hi>Multa enim non illicita, vitiat animus; The mind ſometimes makes that unlawful, which in it ſelf is not:</hi> As that Act of <hi>David</hi>'s in numbring the people, and that of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s in ſhewing his treaſure to the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 20.13.</note> So <hi>Eſ.</hi> 31.1. the vain confidence of Gods people in the <hi>Egyptians</hi> is ſharply reproved, whereas it was lawful for <hi>Solomon</hi> to contract a League with them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.1.

                     </note> that either the King or the people are thereby obliged. <hi>Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> therefore was in the right, when he told the <hi>Romans, That they ſtood not engaged to the enemy for any thing; neither had they commanded any of their Citizens to undertake for them. And therefore, ſaith he to the Senate, ye have nothing to do with us, to whom ye gave no ſuch command; nor with the</hi> Samnites, <hi>with whom ye contracted nothing.</hi> And again, <hi>I utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that any Contract can bind the people, that is made without their approbation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither are they engaged to make good that wherein they and the <hi>Samnites</hi> do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, nor to put the Army into the ſame condition it was in, before the Contract made by the Sponſors. But if the <hi>Samnites</hi> would have engaged the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhould have kept the Army within the Streights of <hi>Caudis,</hi> until they had ſent to the Senate and people, to treat with them concerning a League and a Peace, that they might have judged how much the ſafety of the Army did concern them. And then in caſe they had not ſtood to their Agreement, they might juſtly have ſaid what <hi>Velleius</hi> reports, both they and the <hi>Numantines</hi> did alledge, <hi>That the violation of the Publick Faith ought not to be expiated with the blood of one ſingle perſon.</hi> Whereas now they may with more equity plead, that the whole Army is bound by that Agreement: For ſo the <hi>Numantines</hi> underſtood it; namely, that if the Sponſion was not approved of by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Army which was thereupon ſet at liberty, ſhould have been delivered unto them;<note place="margin">The two Conſuls, the two Queſtors, four Praefects, 12 Tribunes, all which were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, upon the <hi>Caudine</hi> Engagement, but upon the <hi>Numantine,</hi> the Conſul only: the reſt were ſpared for <hi>Tib. Gracchus</hi> his ſake; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Tib. Gracchus</hi> records. With us the Sponſors Eſtates to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and their perſons to be made Slaves.</note> which certainly had been moſt juſt, had that Agreement been made by the Sponſors in their Name, and at their Command: As we read that was which <hi>Hannibal</hi> made with the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> But if the <hi>Samnites</hi> were ſatisfied in the Faith of the perſons engaging, being the two Conſuls and ſix hundred hoſtages whom they had in cuſtody, they might take their ſatisfaction from them, and blame themſelves for accepting them: But from the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they could expect nothing, being no way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto them. But yet in caſe the Sponſors here had pretended to have received power from the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to contract on their behalf, then had they been bound to have made reſtitution and ſatisfaction for the damage, which by their fraud, the <hi>Samnites</hi> had received: But if that appear not, then were they obliged to make good that which was in difference by force of the Negotiation. And in this caſe, not their bodies only had been obliged, but all that their eſtates would have amounted unto; unleſs ſome other penalty had been in that agreement expreſt, in lieu of that wherein the <hi>Samnites</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did differ. For as to the hoſtages, it was expreſly agreed, that if the peace ſhould not be confirmed as it was promiſed, they ſhould be put to death. But whether the ſame puniſhment were to have been inflicted upon the Sponſors is very doubtful. But the ſtipulation of a puniſhment after ſuch a manner made hath this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that in caſe that fact engaged for, may not be performed, nothing elſe can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by that Obligation; for of that which is in difference between them, ſomething that is certain is agreed on, in lieu of ſomething that is uncertain. It was the common opinion of thoſe times, that their Lives were alſo engaged; but amongſt us, it is thought more agreeable to Reaſon, that to ſatisfie for that which the people did not think fit to grant, the Eſtates of the Sponſors, ſhould in the firſt place be ſold: And if that were not enough, their perſons were to be delivered up as Slaves. It is recorded by <hi>Plutarch</hi> of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Val. Max. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> That when the Senate refuſed to confirm an agreement made by him with their enemies, he ſold his own Land to preſerve his Faith: But the <hi>Samnites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up <hi>Brutulus Papius</hi> to the Enemy together with all he had, for breaking a Truce with the <hi>Romans.</hi>

                  <p>There is yet another Queſtion to be reſolved, namely, Whether after notice given to the Supream Power, of an agreement ſo made, ſilence may ſuffice to prove a conſent. And here we are in the firſt place to diſtinguiſh, whether the Sponſion were purely and ſimply made, or whether it were upon condition, that it be ratified by the Supream Power; for if it were conditional, that condition being fulfilled, the Sponſion is of no force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like as that of <hi>Luctatius,</hi> which he made with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> denyed to have been made by their Authority: And therefore another League was by common conſent agreed upon. In the next place, requiſite it is to know, whether any thing were by the Decree of the people acted, which might probably argue their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49430:110"/> of the agreement ſo made. For ſilence of it ſelf, is not ſufficient to prove a conſent, without ſome other thing or deed which in all probability would not have been, had not that engagement been approved of, as hath been already declared when we treated of the relinquiſhing of our propriety. But if any ſuch thing or deed happpen, which cannot probably be referred to any other cauſe, then it may juſtly argue a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Confirmation, as <hi>Cicero</hi> well obſerves in the caſe of the <hi>Gaditans.</hi>

For ſuch an act, hath the force of a poſitive act, and is not to be ranked among thoſe which are barely Abnutive. Now, if that Accord made by <hi>Luctatius,</hi> had conſiſted of many parts; and if it had conſtantly appeared, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had obſerved the reſt of the parts which did abridge them of their Common Right, this had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtifie, that that Agreement in all probability was firmly ratified. It remained now that we ſhould ſpeak of ſuch agreements as Captains and Soldiers make among themſelves, not concerning thoſe things which belong to the Supream Power, but to their own private concerns, and which are permitted unto them to do one to another: But we ſhall have a fitter opportunity to treat hereof, when we come to ſpeak of ſuch accidents as uſually happen in War.</p>

                  <p>Conjectures are uſeful when words or ſentences will admit of diverſe fences, which Rhetoricians term <hi>Amphibologies;</hi> but Logicians do more ſubtilly diſtinguiſh, for if one word will admit of diverſe ſignifications, they call it an <hi>Homonymy;</hi> if a ſentence will admit of a double ſence, they term it an <hi>Amphiboly.</hi> So likewiſe when in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trcts, therer appears any ſeeming repugnancy. Then muſt we fly to conjectures; as alſo where its ſeveral parts ſeem to claſh one againſt the other, we muſt by gueſſing at the ſence, reconcile them if poſſibly we can; but if not, then ſhall that be admitted which pleaſed the Contracters laſt: Becauſe it is not poſſible that at one and the ſame time, the will ſhould imbrace two contraries, and in things that depend upon the will, the latter act derogates from the former, whether it be the act of one Party only, as in a Law, or a Teſtament; or of more, as in Contracts or agreements: in which caſes, the evident obſcurity of the words and ſentences do juſtifie our conjectures. Sometimes again the conjectures themſelves are ſo plain and evident, that they carry us to a ſence contrary to thoſe of the words. The common heads whence theſe conjectures ariſe are chiefly, either from the matter, or from the effect, or from other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>

                  <head>V. From the matter.</head>
                  <p>Firſt from the matter: as the word <hi>Day</hi> (if a truce be made for Thirty days) ought to be underſtood of natural days, but not of Civil, being moſt agreeable to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter. So the word <hi>donare (i. e.)</hi> to give freely is taken to tranſact according
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49430:112"/> to the quality of the affairs. The word, <hi>Arms,</hi> ſometimes ſignifying inſtruments of War, and ſometimes armed Souldiers, is to be underſtood in ſuch a ſence, as is moſt congruous to the matter whereunto it is conjoyned. So when men are promiſed to be delivered, it is to be underſtood of living men, not of dead, contrary to the Cavil of the <hi>Plataeans.</hi> So where Souldiers are required to lay down their Iron or Steel, it is enough if they lay down their weapons, and not their Steel Buttons, as <hi>Pericle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> would have it. And by a free departure out of a City, is meant a ſafe conduct to the place agreed on, contrary to that fact of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And by leaving half a Fleet, is meant the one half of the number of Ships whole, not diſſected, contrary to what the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> dealt with <hi>Antiochus.</hi> The ſame judgement may paſs upon the like caſes.</p>

                  <p>Then from the effect, the chiefeſt whereof is this, If the word taken in the moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſence do infer an effect contrary to reaſon; then may we fly to conjectures. For where the word is ambiguous we muſt take it in ſuch a ſence, as will admit of no incongruity. It was therefore but a fooliſh Cavil of <hi>Braſidas,</hi> who having promiſed to depart with his Army out of the fields of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> denyed afterwards that the place where his Camp was pitcht, belonged to the <hi>Boeotians;</hi> as if that promiſe had been made, in reference to the poſſeſſion which the preſent fortune of the War had given him, and not to the ancient bounds of the <hi>Boeotians:</hi> in which ſenſe the agreement had been void.</p>

For it is to be preſumed that in a caſe that is dubious, the will doth conſtantly adhere to one ſence. As in <hi>Homer</hi> where it is ſaid it was agreed between <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> that <hi>Helen</hi> ſhould be his that ſhould be the Victor; it was afterwards judged who ſhould be the Victor, namely he that killed the other.<note place="margin">

Thus things given in reference to a Marriage, alter not their property, in caſe the Marriage ſucceed not.</p>

                  <p>Theſe diſtinctions being thus obſerved, we are to guide our conjectures by theſe rules, in things not odious, the words are to be underſtood in their full propriety as they are vulgarly taken; and in caſe there be any Ambiguity in them, then are they to be taken in the largeſt ſence: As when the Maſculine only is expreſt, both Sexes are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and where things are mentioned indifferently, they ſhall be underſtood univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                     <note place="margin">See <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20. §. 11.</note> ſhall be underſtood ſo as to imply the reſtoring him to the poſſeſſion of that which hath been forceably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him: For the words in their largeſt ſignification will admit of this conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Cicero</hi> pleads in his Oration againſt <hi>Caecina.</hi> But in ſuch as are yet more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, if he that promiſeth any thing be verſt in the Law, or uſe the advice of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, the words ſhall then be yet more largely underſtood, ſo as to include the ſignification of Art, or that ſenſe which the Law hath given it. But to have recourſe to ſuch Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are plainly improper, we ought not, unleſs it be where ſome abſurdity would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enſue, or when ſomewhat would render the Agreement unprofitable. On the contrary, if neceſſity ſhall ſo require, to avoid either ſome manifeſt injuſtice, or ſome as evident abſurdity, we may not interpret the words more ſtrictly than their Propriety will bear. And though there be no ſuch neceſſity, yet if there appear either manifeſt equity, or very great utility in the reſtriction, we are to confine our ſelves within the ſtricteſt bounds of Propriety, unleſs other circumſtances forbid it. But in ſuch as are odious, that the burthen may be moderated, even Figurative Speeches are ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: And therefore in voluntary grants, and in the remiſſion of that which is a mans Right, though the words be general, yet are they to be reſtrained unto thoſe things, to which in probability they were intended. And amongſt things of this kind, that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times underſtood to be poſſeſt, which we have hopes may be recovered. So ſuccours promiſed by one party only, are preſumed to be raiſed at the charge of that party that requires them.</p>

Yea, certainly they might, but not by vertue of the League, but by the Law of Nature, which that League had not abrogated: So that the <hi>Saguntines</hi> were at that time both to the <hi>Romans</hi> and to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in ſuch a ſtate, as if in that League there had been no mention at all made of Friends: In which caſe, both the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might revenge the injuries done them, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> might alſo juſtly defend them, without breaking their League one with the other.

It was therefore a foul gloſs which the <hi>Romans</hi> did afterwards put upon that Promiſe, when they urged, That by <hi>Carthage</hi> they meant the multitude of their Citizens, and not their City, (which, though improper, may be granted, becauſe of that attribute, <hi>Free,</hi> which is more agreeable to their Citizens than to their Town).

                  <p>Another Queſtion likewiſe doth uſually ariſe concerning Contracts real and perſonal. When we have to do with a free people, there is no queſtion, but that the Contract that is made with them, is in its own nature real, becauſe the ſubject is a thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. Yea, though that popular State ſhould turn into a Monarchy, yet would the League hold, becauſe the body of the people is ſtill the ſame, though the head be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; neither doth the Supreme Power ceaſe to be the power of the People, becauſe exerciſed by the King: where we muſt except this caſe, namely, where it appears, that the cauſe was proper to that State only, as when Free Cities enter into a Social League for defence of their own Liberties. But if a League be contracted with a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49430:113"/> King, it is not inſtantly to be accounted Perſonal: Becauſe, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> well obſerves, for the moſt part the perſon is inſerted in the League: Not that the League is perſonal, but that it may appear by whom that League was made. But if it be inſerted in the League, That it ſhould ſtand for ever; or that it is ſo made for the general good of the kingdom; or that it is made with him and his Succeſſors: (For this addition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is uſual, ſaith <hi>Libanius,</hi> in his defence of <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi>) Or to continue for ſuch a limited time, (as moſtly ſome of theſe are inſerted:) It will from hence ſufficiently appear that the League is real. Such was the League made between the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which when his Son <hi>Perſeus</hi> denyed to bind him, was the cauſe of the War enſuing. There are alſo other words that may ſerve to prove a League to be real, yea, and ſometimes the matter it ſelf may adminiſter ground for probable conjectures. And where the conjectures are equally probable, there we may conclude, That thoſe Leagues which are favourable and equal, ſhall be accounted real, thoſe that are grievous and hateful, Perſonal: Leagues made for the preſervation of mutual Peace or Commerce are favourable; thoſe that are made for War are not always odious, as ſome hold; but if they are made for mutual defence, they draw near to ſuch as are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable: But thoſe that are for a Social War do too nearly approach to thoſe that are burthenſome. Beſides, in thoſe that are made for any War, great reſpect is to be had to the Prudence and Juſtice of thoſe with whom we contract: That they be ſuch as will not engage us in a War, either unjuſtly, or too raſhly, when it may be avoided. And as to that ſaying, <hi>That Societies are diſſolved by Death,</hi> I alledge it not here; for this appertaineth to Private Societies, and is determinable by the Civil Law: And therefore whether the <hi>Fidenates, Latines, Etruſians</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi> did right or wrong in departing from their League upon the death of <hi>Romulus, Tullus Ancus, Priſcus</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi> cannot rightly be determined by us, becauſe the words of the League it ſelf are not extant. The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being depoſed by the Eſtates of the Realm, and impriſoned in <hi>England,</hi> and her Son an Infant ſolemnly Crowned: The <hi>French</hi> refuſed to own any but the depoſed Queen, ſaying, <hi>That the ancient League between her and the</hi> French <hi>King was to be obſerved.</hi> Whereunto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> replyed, <hi>That ſhe being depoſed, and her young Son inaugurate, the</hi> French <hi>King ought by that League to defend him; for that ancient League was not contracted betwixt the perſons, but betwixt the Kingdoms of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Scotland: Which was plain by the very words of that League,<note place="margin">Camden Eliz. anno <hi>1572.</hi>
                     </note> wherein it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, <hi>That if the Crown of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould be at any time controverted, the</hi> French <hi>King ſhould defend him to whom the Eſtates of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould adjudge it.</hi> Whereunto not much different is that controverſie in <hi>Juſtin,</hi> Whether the Cities of the <hi>Medes,</hi> which had been Tributary, did change their condition with the change of their Empire. For it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Whether in that Convention they had committed themſelves to the protection of the <hi>Medes.</hi> And here we muſt note, that <hi>Bodine</hi>'s Argument is by no means to be admitted, That the Leagues of Princes bind not their Succeſſors, becauſe the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory power of an Oath dyes with him that takes it. For an Oath ſometimes binds the perſon only, and yet may the Promiſe made and confirmed by that Oath, bind the Heir. Neither is it altogether true, that all Leagues are grounded upon Oaths; for uſually there is power enough in the very Promiſe to bind, though for the more reverence, thoſe Promiſes are confirmed by Oaths. <hi>Publius Valerius</hi> being Conſul, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> bound themſelves by Oath to aſſemble at the Summons of the Conſul; he dying, and <hi>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> ſucceeding him, the Tribunes of the people began to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, alledging that <hi>Valerius</hi> being dead, the people were freed from that Oath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Livy</hi> gives his Judgement thus, <hi>That general contempt of the Gods that now rageth, had not then corrupted that age: Neither were men then ſo audacious, as to give unto their Oaths what Interpretation they pleaſed, and thereunto to adapt their Laws: But they chuſe rather to compoſe their manners unto that, whereunto they had ſo religiouſly ſworn.</hi>

                  <head>XX. A conjecture offering it ſelf either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and when.</head>
                  <p>There is alſo another way of interpreting by conjectures beyond the ſignification of the words wherein the Promiſe is contained: And this alſo is two-fold, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them farther than the words ſignifie, or by reſtraining them. But that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which reſtrains the ſignification of words is eaſie, but that which enlargeth them, more difficult. For as in all humane things, the want of any one cauſe is enough to make all the reſt ineffectual: But to produce an effect, all the cauſes muſt concur; ſo alſo in this caſe of obligation, that conjecture that ſhall extend the Obligation is not raſhly to be admitted: But with much more caution than in the caſe before mentioned, where we admit of words in their largeſt ſignification, though not much in uſe. For here we raiſe our conjectures without regard had to the words promiſing, which cannot intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an obligation, unleſs the Conjectures be very certain; for here a parity of Reaſon is not ſufficient, unleſs it be the very ſame: Neither is the ſame Reaſon at all times ſufficient; becauſe, as I ſaid before, Reaſon doth often ſo move us, that to ſhew our own freedome, our will is of it ſelf a ſufficient cauſe of our Promiſes, without any other Reaſon. Now to juſtifie ſuch an extended conjecture beyond the words of the Promiſe, it is neceſſary that it ſhould plainly appear, That the Reaſon under which that caſe which we would comprehend falls, was the only and moſt efficacious cauſe which moved the Promiſer; and that that Reaſon was in its generality ſo conſidered by him, becauſe otherwiſe the Promiſe would prove either unjuſt or unprofitable. As for Example, An agreement that ſuch a place ſhould not be ſurrounded with walls, being made at ſuch a time when no other Fortifications were in uſe, ſhould doubtleſs extend to all Muniments, though but of Earth, in caſe it do appear, that the only reaſon why Walls were prohibited, was, That that place ſhould not be fortified. Another Example is uſually brought of a man, who believing his Wife to be with Child, diſpoſeth his Eſtate to ſuch a man in caſe that Child ſhould dye, which by all probable conjectures ſhould be extended to this ſenſe, Or if ſuch a Child ſhould not be born: For certain it is, That the Will of the Teſtator was moved with this only conſideration, That then he ſhould have no Child of his own to inherit it: This caſe we ſhall find, not among the Lawyers only,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1</hi> &amp; <hi>2.</hi> de Orat.

The Will: Which if it could be underſtood by ſilence, we ſhould have no need of Words: But becauſe that cannot be, therefore were words invented, but ſuch as ſhould not hinder the Will, but declare it.</hi> And a little after, in the ſame Oration, he adds, <hi>Idem jus eſſe, ubi perſpicitur una atque eadem cauſa aequitatis; Where there manifeſtly appeared but one and the ſame cauſe of Equity, (i. e.)</hi> where there was the ſame ſolitary cauſe moving, <hi>It may be preſumed there is alſo one and the ſame Right.</hi> Thus <hi>Philo</hi> in his Special Laws proves that it is Adultery to lye with a woman that is betrothed to another, and he adds this reaſon, <hi>Quia idem valent ſponſalia quod Nuptiae; Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuch Eſpouſals are equal to Marriages.</hi>

The proper office to judge at the Will by Right Reaſon, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſigns to Prudence in the underſtanding, and in the Will, to Equity, which he very fitly defines to be the Correction or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that wherein the Law by Reaſon of its generality is deficient: Which ought to take place, as well in Teſtaments as in Contracts reſpectively. For ſeeing that all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent caſes could neither be foreſeen by the Law-giver, nor excepted in the Law; therefore there is a neceſſity that ſome liberty ſhould be granted for the exempting of ſuch caſes, as he that made the Law would have exempted, had he been preſent, or could he have foreſeen it: And yet is not this raſhly to be admitted, for that were to make himſelf Lord over another mans act; but then only, when we have ſufficient ſigns to juſtifie our Conjectures. Whereof none can be more juſt than this, when they would binds us to things repugnant to the Laws either of God or Nature. For ſuch Laws having no power to oblige, are neceſſarily to be exempted. <hi>Quaedam etiamſi nulla ſignificatione Legis comprehenſa ſint, natura tamen exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piuntur; There are ſome things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Quintilian) that naturally are exempted, although they are not comprehended by any ſignification of the Law.</hi> As he that hath promiſed to reſtore a Sword to him who entruſted him with it, if the man to whom the Promiſe was made, be mad, he ought not to deliver it, leſt he thereby create danger to himſelf, or to ſome others that are innocent.

                  <p>The Second ſign ſhall be this, When ſtrictly to follow the words of the Promiſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is not of it ſelf and altogether unlawful. But when it binds to ſuch things as to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and well-balanced Judgement are too grievous and intollerable: And that whether we reſpect humanity it ſelf abſolutely, or by comparing the perſon promiſing, and the thing promiſed, with the end for which ſuch a Promiſe or Contract was made. So he that lends a thing for ſuch a time, may require it before that time, if he ſtand in great want of it: Becauſe it is preſumed, that no man would willingly do his Friend a courteſie in that, wherein he ſhould do himſelf a manifeſt injury. So he that ſhall promiſe ſuccours to his Allies, ſhall be excuſed in caſe he be engaged in War at home, ſo far forth as he ſhall ſtand in need of thoſe Forces. In like manner, he that promiſeth immunity from Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Taxes, means only from ordinary and annual Taxes, not from thoſe that may be impoſed in times of greateſt danger, for the defence of the Common-wealth. Wherefore it was too looſely ſaid of <hi>Cicero, That thoſe Promiſes were not to be performed, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to him to whom they were made; nor thoſe which did more endamage the Promiſer, than benefit him to whom they were made.</hi> For the perſon promiſing is no competent Judge whether the thing promiſed will be profitable to him to whom it is promiſed, unleſs it be in ſuch a caſe as is before inſtanced of apparent madneſs: Neither is every damage ſufficient to abſolve the Promiſer from the performance of his Promiſe, but the damage muſt be ſuch, as even from the very nature of the act it may be believed, That could it have been foreſeen, it would have been exempted. So he that is engaged to do ſo many days ſervice for another, is acquitted from his engagement, if either his Father or his Son be affected with ſome dangerous ſickneſs: This was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s opinion in this caſe, <hi>If being retained to plead the cauſe of thy Client, thy Son ſhould in the mean time fall deſperately ſick,</hi> Non eſt contra officium,<note place="margin">Off. l. <hi>1.</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">De Invent. <hi>2.</hi> Verina <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> hath left us out of ſome ancient and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors, which are by no means to be ſlighted, yet in mine opinion are they not digeſted into a right order. And therefore I think fit to place them thus, That that which is permitted do always give place to that which is enjoyned: For, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Semper potentior lex eſt qua vetat, quàm quae permittit; That Law that commands is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtronger than that which permits.</hi> Becauſe he that permits any thing is conceived to permit it, unleſs ſomewhat elſe do hinder, than what is then treated of; and therefore <hi>Plus valet ſanctio, quam permiſſio, A Decree or Sanction is more prevalent than a Toleration.</hi> Secondly, That what is to be done at a time prefixt be always preferred before what may be done at any time. From whence it follows, That for the moſt part, that which forbids, is to be preferred before that which enjoyns: Becauſe what prohibits, binds us at all times, but ſo doth not that which commands, unleſs it be either when the time is expreſt, or that the command comprehends under it ſome tacite prohibition. Again, that in ſuch agreements as are in their qualities before-named, equal, That ſhould be preferred, which is moſt proper, and comes neareſt to the matter in queſtion: For Particulars are always more efficacious than Generals. And in things prohibited, that thoſe which have a penalty affixt, be preferred before thoſe that have none; and thoſe that have a greater penalty, before thoſe that have a leſſer. As alſo that thoſe be preferred that have cauſes affixt, either more honeſt or more profitable: And in the laſt place, that that which was ſpoken laſt be more valid than that which was ſpoken before. Of what hath been already ſaid, this alſo muſt be here repeated, That look what Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſworn unto, muſt be underſtood in the moſt uſual Propriety of Speech: And that all ſecret reſervations and reſtrictions, more than the very nature of the thing doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require, be altogether diſowned. Wherefore alſo in caſe an Agreement ſworn ſhall in effect claſh with that which is not ſworn, that which was bound by an Oath ſhall be preferred.</p>

For if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the words of him that offers conditions affirmatively, he ſhall be thought to repeat thoſe very words in his Promiſe, according to the Nature of Relatives.

                  <head>II. Among whom this Right takes place.</head>
                  <p>But yet we muſt in the firſt place, know that this Right of Nations, whatever it be, belongs to ſuch Legats only, who are ſent by ſuch as have the Soveraign power, in both Nations between themſelves. For ſuch as are ſent from Provinces, particular Cities, or other ſubordinate powers, are governed not by the Law of Nations, which is between diverſe people, but by the Civil Law. An Embaſſador in <hi>Livy</hi> calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Publick Meſſenger of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> And in another place, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate declares that the Right of Embaſſages was granted, not to a Citizen, but to a Foreigner: And <hi>Cicero</hi> to prove that they ought not to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>M. Anthony,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non enim cum</hi> Hannibale <hi>res eſt, hoſte reipublicae, ſed cum cive; For we have not now to do with</hi> Hannibal, <hi>a publick Enemy, but with a Citizen and a Subject.</hi> Now what is meant by a Foreigner, <hi>Virgil</hi> will inform us, as well as any Lawyer can do:
<q>
                        <l>A Foreign Land is that, as I ſuppoſe,</l>
                        <l>Which being free, to us no duty owes.</l>
                     </q> But they that are Confederates, though upon Terms very unequal; yet becauſe they are <hi>ſui juris, a free people,</hi> have likewiſe this Right of ſending Embaſſages: Yea, and they alſo that are partly Subjects, and partly free, for that part wherein they are free. But ſuch things as are conquered in a ſolemn War, and driven out of their Kingdoms do loſe, together with their other goods, this Right of ſending Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. And therefore did <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> (having conquered <hi>Perſeus</hi> in open War) detain the Heralds, which he ſent unto him. But yet, in Civil Wars neceſſity doth ſometimes plead for the admittance of this Right, though irregular: As namely, when the people are ſo equally divided into parts, that it is an hard matter to judge, in whether part conſiſts the Right of Empire; or when two perſons with very equal titles, contend for the Succeſſion. For in this caſe, one Nation for that time may be accounted as two.<note place="margin">Hiſt. l. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> Thus are the <hi>Flaviani</hi> accuſed by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that in their Civil diſcord, they had violated the Right of Embaſſadors, Sacred even among Barbarous Nations, in the <hi>Vitellians.</hi> And <hi>Magnenſius</hi> in <hi>Zoſimus</hi> did long debate it in his mind,<note place="margin">Zof. l. <hi>11.</hi>

                  <p>There is a twofold Right due to Embaſſadors by the Law of Nations: Firſt, that they be admitted; Secondly, That they be not injured. As concerning the former, <hi>Livy</hi> brings in <hi>Hanno</hi> inveighing againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in the Senate of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> thus, <hi>Our goodly General refuſeth to admit into his Camp Embaſſadors coming from friends, and for friends.</hi> Jus Gentium ſuſtulit, <hi>He hath broken the Law of Nations:</hi> which notwithſtanding muſt not be underſtood ſo largely as if none ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; for a Prince may deny an Embaſſador admittance; and he may command him to depart his Kingdom, if he behave himſelf ſeditiouſly, but that none ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe denyed: Now cauſes there may be, Firſt, from him that ſends, Secondly, from him that is ſent, and Thirdly, from the matter of Embaſſage. As to the firſt, we read that <hi>Pericles</hi> diſmiſt <hi>Meleſippus,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Embaſſador, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Territories of <hi>Athens,</hi> becauſe he came from an Armed Enemy.

                  <p>Concerning the latter priviledge of Embaſſadors, namely, That they ſhould not be moleſted, the queſtion is more arduous and knotty; and by the beſt Wits of this Age, variouſly handled. In the ſtating whereof, they have reſpect, Firſt, To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Secondly, To their Attendants, Thirdly, To their Goods. As to their Perſons, ſome think, that they are to be protected againſt all unjuſt force only, eſteeming their priviledges to be underſtood of Common Right. Others are of opinion, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Emperours are not for every cauſe to be moleſted, but only when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do violate the Law of Nations, which opens a door ſo wide, that all delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies are puniſhable in Emperours, except ſuch as are committed againſt the Civil Law: For in thoſe committed againſt the Law of Nations, are contained even thoſe that are committed againſt the Law of Nature. Others do yet reſtrain this force to thoſe, who ſhall be found to act any thing againſt the State of the Common-wealth, or againſt the honour and dignity of the perſon to whom they are ſent: which ſome think to be of dangerous conſequence; and therefore would have complaint made to him that ſent them, and the Embaſſadors ſent home, to be by him puniſhed. Others there are, who think it fit in this caſe to appeal to other Kings and Free States, that are not concerned; deſiring their advice therein, which indeed may ſtand with prudence, but not to be impoſed upon us as a Law. The Arguments which every one of theſe do bring to ſtrengthen their ſeveral opinions, do conclude nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly: Becauſe this Right is not grounded upon reaſons that are certain, as the Law of Nature is, but it receives its bounds from the conſent of Nations. Now the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may either altogether provide for the ſafety of Embaſſadors, or with ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain exceptions. For advantages may by either of theſe ariſe to the Common-wealth: By this latter, the puniſhment inflicted upon ſuch as notoriouſly offend, deters others; and ſecures the peace of that Nation. By the former, the profit ariſeth to the State by Embaſſies, which are the more eaſily and willingly undertaken, when the perſons ſent are encouraged thereunto, as knowing that the greateſt care that can be, is taken for their ſecurity; we are therefore to obſerve, how far forth the Nations did agree in this point; which cannot be evinced by examples alone. For of theſe we have enough extant on either ſide; we muſt therefore have recourſe herein, as well to the Judgement of the Wiſeſt Men, as to our own moſt probable conjectures. For the Judgement of the Wiſeſt Men are guided by two notable precedents; one out of <hi>Livy,</hi> the other out of <hi>Saluſt.</hi> That out of <hi>Livy,</hi> by the Embaſſadors of <hi>Tarquine,</hi> who pretended only to treat with the Senate about ſome of <hi>Tarquine</hi>'s Goods, but were found conſpiring with the Citizens to betray the City. And when it was moved in the Senate, What ſhould be done with them, It was at length reſolved on, <hi>That though they deſerved to be proceeded againſt as enemies,</hi> yet <hi>valuit Jus Gentium, The Law of Nations muſt be preſerved.</hi> Whence we may conclude, That by the Law of Nations, Protection is due unto Embaſſadors, though they ſhould be found plotting againſt the State they are ſent unto. That in <hi>Saluſt,</hi> doth more immediately reſpect the Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of Embaſſadors, than Embaſſadors themſelves; and yet by an Argument drawn from that which is leſs credible, to that which is more, may ſerve to prove, what the Law of Nations allows to Embaſſadors in the caſe aforeſaid. <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome</hi> as an Aſſiſtant in the Embaſſage, but was found ſtirring up the Citizens to Rebellion, ſaith thus, <hi>Fit reus magis ex aequo bonoque quam ex jure Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49430:120"/> He was made Guilty, rather by the Rules of Equity, than by the Law of Nations.</hi> Where by <hi>aequum &amp; bonum,</hi> is meant the meer Law of Nature, which requires, that he that doth evil, ſhould ſuffer for it being found. But the Law of Nations excepts from this General Rule, Embaſſadors, and ſuch as (like them) come upon the ſecurity of the Publick Faith. Wherefore it is contrary to the Intereſt of the Law of Nations, that Embaſſadors ſhould be held guilty, as many other things are, which are permitted by the Law of Nature. Our conjectures alſo may be thus guided. Moſt probable it is, that the priviledges granted to Embaſſadors, are ſomewhat more than what is due unto others by common right. But in caſe they are no longer to be ſecured, than whilſt they live re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, what have they more than others? Beſides the benefit that accrews unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by ſecuring their perſons, doth by much preponderate that which we may hope for in their puniſhment. For his puniſhment may be required of him that ſent him, if he be willing: which if refuſed, then we can but make War upon him, as being acceſſary to the crime by his approving it. But ſome will object, That it is better that one ſhould be puniſhed, than a multitude engaged in a War. But if he that ſent the Embaſſador do approve of his Fact, the puniſhment of the Embaſſador cannot free us from the Danger. (Now whether it be ſafeſt for the Common-wealth, to connive and diſſemble the fact, or to run the hazard of a War, will be the queſtion). On the other ſide, the ſafety of Embaſſadors, would be but ſlenderly provided for, if they were to give an account to any, but unto him that ſent them. For ſince the deſigns of them that ſend Embaſſadors, and of thoſe to whom they are ſent, are for the moſt part diverſe, if not contrary, it cannot poſſibly be, but that ſome of their Actions will ſeem to be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. And although ſome are ſo manifeſt, as not to admit of any doubt, yet is the univerſal danger ſufficient for the equity and benefit of an univerſal Law. Wherefore mine opinion is, That by the Conſent of Nations, that Common Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which requires, that every man that reſides in a Foreign Countrey, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf to the Laws and Cuſtomes of that Countrey, ſhould except Embaſſadors, who as they are imagined to be the perſons of them that ſend them: (for ſo ſpeaks <hi>Cicero</hi> of a certain Embaſſador, <hi>Senatus Faciem ſecum attulerat, He brought with him the Majeſty of a Senate, the Authority of a Common-wealth.</hi>) So may they be imagined to live in their own Countrey; and therefore not bound by the Civil Laws of the place they are really in. Wherefore if the offence be ſuch as may ſafely be ſlighted, it is either to be diſſembled, or the Embaſſador commanded to depart the Kingdom; which (as <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us) was done unto him who procured the Flight of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages from <hi>Rome.</hi> The like was done by <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Embaſſadour, and by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadors. For when <hi>Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador, was found practiſing with <hi>Throckmorton</hi> and others to bring in a Foreign Power into <hi>England,</hi> and to depoſe the Queen; he being a man of a Turbulent Spirit, and abuſing the priviledges of an Embaſſador, was commanded to depart the Realm. But when the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> delegated Embaſſador from the impriſoned Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> was found deſigning means both within the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and without, to raiſe Rebellion, and to procure a Foreign Invaſion: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded of the moſt Learned Civilians of that Age, Whether an Embaſſador raiſing Rebellion againſt the Prince, to whom he was ſent, might enjoy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of an Embaſſador; it was anſwered, That he had thereby loſt his priviledge, and might be puniſhed: as <hi>Camden</hi> records it <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. and 1584. And we may alſo remember, that at another time the <hi>Romans</hi> cauſed the <hi>Tarentine</hi> Embaſſadors to be whipt with Rods, for conveying their hoſtages out of <hi>Rome;</hi> but this was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Tarentines</hi> being conquered, began then to be under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> So we read of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, that he commanded the Embaſſador of the Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> as being his Subject, that he ſhould not depart his Court without leave, as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> relates it. But in caſe the Crime be heinous and menacing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger to the State, then is the Embaſſador to be ſent back to his Maſter, with demand, That he either puniſh him, or deliver him up to be puniſhed: as we read of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> that they demanded the <hi>Fabii</hi> to be delivered up unto them. But, as I have often ſaid before, <hi>All humane Laws are ſo made, that they oblige not in extream neceſſity;</hi> the ſame may alſo be ſaid of theſe Rights of Embaſſadors. Wherefore that we may prevent ſome imminent danger, eſpecially to the Common-wealth, if no fitter means can be thought on, we may both apprehend and examine him; as the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls did the Embaſſadors of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> All intercourſe by Letters being in the firſt place prevented, as <hi>Livy</hi> directs<note n="†" place="margin">Literarumim-primus habita cura, ne inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderent.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49430:120"/> by way of puniſhment, but by way of Natural Defence. So the <hi>Gaules</hi> might have killed the <hi>Fabii,</hi> whom <hi>Livy</hi> brands, as being the Infringers of humane Right. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Herald in <hi>Euripides</hi> attempted by force to reſcue the Suppliants, he was by force reſiſted; and when the Herald demanded of him,
<q>Dur'ſt thou, an Herald, hither ſent, to ſmite?</q> He was anſwered,
<q>Yes, if that Herald firſt begin so fight.</q> And becauſe that Herald did act by Force and Violence, he was ſlain by the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> records in the Life of <hi>Herod.</hi> By the like diſtinction,<note place="margin">Offic. l. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> doth <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> reſolve this Queſtion, Whether a Son ought to accuſe his own Father being a Traytor to his Countrey? Namely, if the Danger be great and imminent, he ought by way of prevention; but in caſe the danger be paſt, he ought not by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the Fact. <hi>The very Name of an Embaſſador,</hi> ſaith <hi>Theodatus</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Embaſſador, <hi>is with all men held as ſacred and honourable; which honour they may juſtly claim, whileſt they uphold their dignity by their modeſty. For moſt men are of opinion, that it is lawful to kill an Embaſſador, if he be injurious to the perſon of him to whom he is ſent, or ſhall defile himſelf, by violating the Rights of Marriage.</hi> And when ſome Embaſſadors did alledge, that they were ſo far from the ſuſpicion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Adultery, that they could not ſtir abroad without a Guard, they prudently added, <hi>That if an Embaſſador did deliver no other Meſſage,</hi>

And no marvel, for Hiſtorians do uſually record, not only things that are juſtly and piouſly done, but thoſe alſo that are done unjuſtly, in heat of anger, raſhly, and impotently. But the Law of Nations doth not only carefully provide for the honour of the Perſon ſending, but for the ſecurity of the Perſon ſent.

And therefore though there ſhould be no injuſtice done, in reſpect of the Prince that ſends his Embaſſador, as having juſtly deſerved it for the affront given him in the wrongs done unto his Embaſſador; yet to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſent there would be done a manifeſt injuſtice, becauſe by vertue of that tacite agreement he might juſtly claim his Indemnity. And therefore it was not only mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly, but juſtly done by <hi>Scipio,</hi> according to the Law of Nations, who though the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſadors had been very hardly uſed at <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet when the <hi>Romans</hi> brought the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embaſſadors unto him, demanding what ſhould be done with them; made anſwer, <hi>Nihil tale quale factum fuit à</hi> Carthaginenſibus; <hi>Nothing of that which the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>did unto the</hi> Romans. Or according to what <hi>Livy</hi> adds, <hi>Nihil ſe facturum inſtitutis populi</hi> Romani <hi>indignum; That he would do nothing unworthy of the</hi> Roman <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Diodorus</hi> adds this Reaſon, <hi>Leſt what we blame in them, we juſtifie in our ſelves.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, though they were not ignorant of what the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had done, yet diſmiſt their Embaſſadors in ſafety. Thus did <hi>Conſtantius</hi> remit <hi>Titianus,</hi> being ſent unto him by <hi>Magnentius;</hi> though his own Embaſſador, <hi>Philip,</hi> ſent unto <hi>Magnentius,</hi> had been hy him detained, as <hi>Zoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> teſtifies. And when long before the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſador, <hi>Cornelius Aſina,</hi> was put in Chains by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embaſſador, being at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> was afraid of the like meaſure, the Conſuls ſtood up in the Senate, and thus beſpake him: <hi>Iſto te metu,</hi> Hanno, <hi>fides Civitatis noſtra liberet; Let the Faith of our City,</hi> Hanno, <hi>free thee from this fear.</hi>

                  <p>Not only the Embaſſadour himſelf, but his Followers and Goods are to partake of the ſame priviledge (if he pleaſe.) And therefore the Ancient Form of words uſed by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours and Heralds unto the Kings to whom they were ſent, were theſe, <hi>O King, doſt thou admit of me, as the Royal Meſſenger of the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>together with my Goods and Followers.</hi> And by the <hi>Julian</hi> Law, not only they that offered violence to the perſons of the Embaſſadours themſelves, but they that injured any of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, were found guilty, <hi>De vi publiea,</hi> Of violence done by force and arms.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49430:121"/> But this Sanctimony belongs unto them, but as they are Attendants to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and therefore no further due than he ſhall pleaſe: Wherefore in caſe any hainous crime be committed by them, they are required to be delivered up by the Embaſſadour to puniſhment, but they are by no means to be taken from him by force. Which, when once done by the <hi>Achaians,</hi> who ſeized upon ſome <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who attended upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſadours, the <hi>Romans</hi> preſently cryed out, That they had violated the Law of Nations. Whereunto alſo we may refer the judgement of <hi>Saluſt</hi> concerning <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> which we have formerly quoted. But if the Embaſſadour ſhall refuſe to deliver him, then we are to proceed in the ſame manner, as is before preſcribed againſt the Embaſſadour himſelf. But whether the Embaſſadour have juriſdiction over his own Family, or whether his Houſe be a Sanctuary for all ſuch as ſhall flye unto it for refuge, depends upon the pleaſure of him to whom he is ſent; for this belongs not at all to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p>The movable Goods alſo of an Embaſſadour, and whatſoever elſe ſhall apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to his perſon, are not to be received in pawn, or attached for any debt; neither by any ordinary courſe of Law, nor by the hands of the King himſelf (which ſome hold as the truer opinion.) For no force or compulſion muſt be, by any means, uſed againſt him or his; that ſo he may enjoy an abſolute and perfect ſecurity. And if he ſhall have contracted any debt, and have no real Eſtate (as it uſually falls out) he muſt only be fairly intreated to diſcharge them; which if he refuſe, then is he that ſent him to be likewiſe intreated to pay them. But if neither will do it, then in the laſt place we muſt flee to ſuch Remedies, as are provided againſt ſuch Debtors, as do reſide in Foreign Countries.</p>
                  <p>Yet is it no breach of their priviledge, that their Coffers be ſearched at their firſt entrance, in caſe it be according to the cuſtom of the Country whereunto they are ſent: As it happened to Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who complaining thereof to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and deſiring to be recalled,<note place="margin">Cambden Eliz.

                     <hi>Neither is there any cauſe to fear (as ſome may imagine) that if the caſe be thus with Embaſſadours, no man will truſt them, or make any Contract with them: For the King himſelf though he cannot be compelled to any thing, yet never wants Creditors (if they give good prices.) And among ſome Nations, as</hi> Damaſcen <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, it is cuſtomable, That as to ſuch debts as are contracted upon truſt, there is no remedy provided by Law, no more than there is againſt men that are ungrateful: So that men in thoſe parts are compelled, either to pay readily for what they buy, and on both ſides to fulfil alike all their agreements, or to content themſelves with the bare faith and credit of the Debtor.</hi> Seneca <hi>ſeems to envy the happineſs of thoſe Countries, by wiſhing the ſame cuſtom in all places:</hi>

This is the reaſon given by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> in commiſeration of mankind,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Decl.</hi> 6.</note> we preſerve their Bodies from the incurſions of Birds and Beaſts. So <hi>Cicero</hi> in his firſt Book of Invention, <hi>Being torn by Wild Beaſts, he wanted in his Death the common Honour of Burial.</hi> And God himſelf threatens ſome wicked Kings by his Prophets,<note place="margin">1 King. 14.11.</note> 
                     <hi>That they ſhould be Buried with the Burial of an Aſs, and that the Dogs ſhould lick their Blood.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 22.</note> Neither doth <hi>Lactantius</hi> give any other reaſon for Burials than this, <hi>We cannot ſuffer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Image of God to lye as a prey to Fowls and Beaſts.</hi> Nor doth St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

Not much different from this is that of <hi>Sopater, To bury the dead is a very decent thing, inſtituted by Nature it ſelf, leſt the Bodies of men after death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, ſhould be expoſed to ſhame and reproach. And they that indulge this Honour to the Bodies of the Dead, perform an office acceptable unto all, whether Gods or Semi-Gods. For it is not congruous to Reaſon, That the Secrets of Humane Nature ſhould after Death be expoſed to publick view. And therefore hath Antiquity traduced this Cuſtome of burying the Bodies of the Dead down even unto us,</hi> Ut Monumento condita clam &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul à conſpectu tabeſcant; <hi>That being depoſited in their Sepulchres, they may rot and moulder away ſecretly and inviſibly.</hi> The like Reaſon is given by <hi>Gregory Nyſſen, We bury the Dead, that ſo what is the ſhame of Humane Nature may not lye expoſed to the Sun.</hi> Neither is this duty of Interring the Dead, due to the perſon of any man, but to Humane Nature it ſelf: And therefore it ought not to be envied to any, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick enemies or private.

                  <p>But yet as concerning ſuch notorious Malefactors as have deſerved Death, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto Law have ſuffered, there were ſome cauſe to doubt. But that the Divine Law given to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which as it was our guide and directrix to all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo is it to this of Humanity alſo, did command, That ſuch as were hanged on the Gallows, (which was a Death very ignominious among them, as appears <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23.) ſhould be Buried the ſame day. Whence <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.26:</note> That ſo great was the care that the <hi>Jews</hi> took of burials, that they took down the Bodies even of thoſe that were publickly Executed before the Sun went down, and bequeathed them to the Earth.

Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> plead to <hi>Petronius,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> records: <hi>We</hi> (ſay they) <hi>mix our own Bloods by voluntary deaths, for fear leſt whileſt we ſtrive at two things</hi> (i. e.) <hi>to reverence our Emperour, and yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Divine Law, we ſhould incur the diſpleaſure of God: Which danger we may avoid, if by contemning this miſerable Life, we embrace a voluntary Death.</hi> Some of theſe <hi>Jews</hi> would admit of one only caſe, wherein it was lawful for a man to kill himſelf, namely, rather than live to be a perpetual reproach and ſcorn to the Enemies of God. For ſeeing the Power over our lives is not in our ſelves but in God, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> rightly inſtructs his Countrey-men, They preſume that it is the will of God that they ſhould put an end to that reproach by a voluntary death. And hither they refer the Examples of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who ſeeing the True Religion in, and through him, to be held in contempt, choſe rather to dye than that God by him ſhould be diſhonoured. And that alſo of <hi>Saul,</hi> who fell on his own Sword, that ſo he might not be inſulted over by ſuch as were Gods, and his Enemies. For the <hi>Jews</hi> held,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 31.4.</note> That immediately after the Ghoſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> had foretold his Death he repented,<note place="margin">Umbra Samue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</note> and that although he knew he ſhould dye in caſe he did fight; yet rather than he would betray his Countrey, and the Law of God into the hands of his Enemies, he refuſed not to fight: Therein meriting eternal praiſe by the Teſtimony of <hi>David.</hi> And hence it was, that he ſo highly commends the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> for their Piety, in beſtowing an Honourable Interment upon <hi>Saul.</hi> A third Example we have in <hi>Razes</hi> a Senator of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Mac. 14.37.</note> Infinite Examples we may find in our Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, of ſuch, who leſt they ſhould be enforced by Torments to abjure their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have killed themſelves; and of Virgins, who to preſerve their Chaſtity, have caſt themſelves into Rivers, whom notwithſtanding the Church hath honoured with the Crown of Martyrdom.

                     </note> And yet elſewhere ſpeaking of thoſe who to preſerve their Chaſtity killed themſelves, he adds, <hi>Who can be ſo void of humanity as not to forgive them.</hi> Among the <hi>Grecians</hi> alſo there was another ſort of men exempted from Burial, which cuſtome the Locrians object againſt the <hi>Phocenſes,</hi>

                  <head>I. The definition of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</head>
                  <p>ABOVE when we began to aſſign the cauſes of War, we conſidered mens deeds in a twofold reſpect, either as the wrong they did, might be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as it might be puniſhed. Concerning the former we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoken: we come now to the latter, which is Puniſhments, which we ſhall the more accurately diſcuſs, for as much as its Origine and nature being miſunderſtood, hath given occaſion to many errours. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in its general acceptation is, <hi>malum paſſionis quod infligitur ob malum actionis; the evil that we ſuffer for the evil that we do.</hi> And though hard labour be ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon ſome perſons by way of Puniſhment, yet this is in reſpect of the pains and trouble that accompanies thoſe works, and may therefore fitly be referred to paſſion. As for thoſe inconveniencies which ſome men ſuffer without any ſin committed, as by ſome contagious diſeaſe, or as being maimed, or for ſome uncleanneſs, to be debarred the Society of men, or to be made uncapable of ſome office or function, (many whereof we may read of in the Jewiſh Law) theſe are not properly Puniſhments, though for ſome reſemblance they have with them, and by the abuſe of the word, they are ſo called. Among thoſe things that natural inſtinct tells us are lawful and not unjuſt, this is one, <hi>ut malum qui facit, malum ferat; that he that doth evil ſhould ſuffer evil:</hi> which Philoſophers do reckon as the moſt antient, and moſt perfect rule of juſtice, or as one of the Laws of <hi>Radamanthus;</hi> yea ſo antient, and indubitable, that <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo bold as to ſay: <hi>That neither the Gods nor good men durſt ever ſay otherwiſe, but that he that doth wrong deſerves to ſuffer for it. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> makes juſtice <hi>one of Gods immediate attendants, whoſe offer it is to revenge all affronts done to the Divine Law; which all men do naturally make uſe of againſt all men, as being fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens.</hi> And <hi>Hierax</hi> deſcribes juſtice by that which is its principal office, namely, <hi>to hurt thoſe who have firſt hurt others.</hi> And <hi>Hierocles</hi> calls <hi>Juſtice the only cure for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (as if no ſatisfaction could be made for wrongs done but by ſufferance; neither is there any thing that ſo powerfully reſtrains us from ſin, as the apprehenſion of ſome juſt Puniſhment.)<note place="margin">Lactantius de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra dei <hi>c. 17.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>We are therefore very irrational, when we blame either God or men for their ſeverity to us, when we are puniſhed: non enim nocens dicendus qui nocentes afficit poena; for he is not to be blamed that puniſheth, but he that deſerves Puniſhment.</hi> (That which we ſuffer is juſt, becauſe that which we do is unjuſt) <hi>Omnis poena, ſi juſta eſt, peccati poena eſt; Every juſt Puniſhment</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note>) muſt neceſſarily refer to ſome crime: which is true even of thoſe that are inflicted by God himſelf; though ſometimes by reaſon of our ignorance, <hi>latet culpa, ubi non latet poena; the judgment flames out, when the ſin lies ſmothered.</hi>

                  <p>But whether it appertain to diſtributive, or commutative juſtice, divers men are of divers opinions. Some think that they that offend moſt are puniſhed moſt, and ſo on the contrary: And becauſe puniſhment is inflicted as it were by the whole on a part, therefore it is to be referred to attributive juſtice. But whereas in the firſt place they ſay, that this branch of juſtice takes place only where there is an equality to be aſſigned between terms more than two; that this holds not always true, we have already ſhewn in the beginning of this work: Beſides that they that ſin moſt, are puniſhed moſt; and they that offend leaſt, are leaſt puniſhed; this falls out by conſequence only, and was not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and of it ſelf intended: for that which is ſimply, and in the firſt place intended, is, that there be an equality between the offence and the puniſhment, whereof <hi>Horace</hi> thus:

                     <hi>to puniſh all ſins equally is very unjuſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca:</hi> for, as the Scholiaſt upon <hi>Horace</hi> obſerves; <hi>If we inflict the greateſt puniſhments upon the ſmalleſt crimes, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the greateſt will remain either (in part) unpuniſhed, or ſome new puniſhments muſt be invented.</hi> Neither is that much truer which they ſay, that all puniſhment doth proceed from the whole to its parts,<note place="margin">See beneath Sect. 28. 32. and Book 3. c. 11. Sect. 1.</note> as will appear by what we ſhall ſay hereafter. Beſides the true intent and reaſon of diſtributive juſtice properly conſiſts, neither in ſuch an equality, nor in the proceſſion of the whole to its part, as we have elſwhere ſhewed; but in the reſpect had to the fitneſs and aptitude of the Delinquent to ſuch a puniſhment, which doth not infer any right thereunto ſtrictly taken, but is only preparative as giving occaſion unto it; for although he that is puniſhed, ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of puniſhment: yet may we not hence infer, that he muſt neceſſarily undergo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſtributive juſtice may impoſe upon him: Neither do they that refer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49430:127"/> of Delinquents to commutative juſtice, extricate themſelves any better; for they conſider the matter ſo, as if puniſhments were due to a malefactor in the ſame manner, as things are uſually due upon contracts. That which deceives theſe men, is the vulgar manner of ſpeaking, whereby we ſay that puniſhment is due to a malefactor, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper; for he to whom any thing is properly due, hath a right againſt him from whom it is due. But in ſaying a Puniſhment is due unto any man, we mean only this, that it is juſt he ſhould be puniſhed: yet notwithſtanding true it is, that in puniſhments, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative juſtice is ſimply and by it ſelf exerciſed; foraſmuch as he that puniſheth, that he may do it juſtly, ought to have a right to do it, which right ariſeth from the guilt of the delinquent. And herein there is ſomething that draws near unto the nature of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: Becauſe as he that ſells a thing though he mention nothing particularly, yet is preſumed to ſtand obliged to perform all things natural to the ſale: So he that tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Law, doth voluntarily oblige himſelf to the penalty of that Law, becauſe it is not poſſible that there ſhould be any hainous crime that is not puniſhable; ſo that he that is willing directly to tranſgreſs a Law, is by conſequence willing to undergo the penalty of that Law: In which ſenſe, ſome Princes do pronounce ſentence againſt a malefactor thus, <hi>Ipſe te huic poenae ſubdidiſti; thou haſt voluntarily ſubjected thy ſelf to this puniſhment.</hi> And to this purpoſe is that of <hi>Philo: Peccare cum feſtinatis, ad poenam feſtinatis;</hi>

                     <hi>there is a kind of giving and receiving according to the nature of contracts; for he that ſteals or robs me of what is mine, doth for that very thing bind himſelf to undergo ſuch a puniſhment.

                  <p>But yet, to whom this right of puniſhing offenders is due, is not by nature it ſelf deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; this natural reaſon dictates, that a Malefactor may be puniſhed, but not, who ſhould puniſh him; this only nature prompts us to, that it is moſt convenient, that it ſhould be done by one that is his ſuperiour: neither doth ſhe demonſtrate this to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary, unleſs, by ſuperiour, we underſtand him that is innocent, and that we detrude the nocent beneath the degrees of men, and rank them with beaſts which are ſubject unto men. Thus <hi>Democritus</hi> aſcribes it to nature, that the better ſhould govern the worſe; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, that in that order that nature hath placed every thing, that which is worſer was had for the uſe and ſervice of that which was better; which alſo holds true as well in artificial things, as in natural: The conſequence whereof is, that he that is nocent ought not to be puniſhed by him that is at leaſt, equally nocent (for he that ſits as Judge to puniſh Malefactors, ſhould himſelf be free, not only from that particular crime, but from all others that may render him obnoxious to the ſame puniſhment) whence ariſeth that of our Saviour to the Phariſees: <hi>Let him amongſt you that is without ſin,</hi>

                  <head>IV. To what end puniſhments are ordained.</head>
                  <p>Another Queſtion here ariſeth concerning the end we propoſe to our ſelves in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; for what we have hitherto ſaid, amounts to no more than this, that the guilty perſon hath no wrong done him, in caſe he be puniſhed: But from hence it doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that he muſt be puniſhed; nor is it true, for both God and man, we ſee do pardon many men, many offences, and are highly commended for it: for as <hi>Plato</hi> firſt, and after him <hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerved; <hi>There is no wiſe man that puniſheth an offender ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath offended, but becauſe he ſhould not offend again; for what is once done cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, but what is to come may be prevented:</hi> therefore all puniſhments relate to the time to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49430:128"/> come; <hi>Non iraſcitur, ſed cavet. He that puniſheth is not angry, but provident. Diodorus</hi> in <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi> ſpeaking to the Athenians concerning the Mityleneans, ſaith, <hi>That they had, indeed, done very unjuſtly, but not ſo as that they ſhould be deſtroyed, unleſs it ſhould be found expedient.</hi> But theſe things are true in puniſhments amongſt men, becauſe we are all link'd together in Bonds of conſanguinity; ſo that we ſhould not hurt one another, unleſs it be for a more general good: <hi>For if one hand hurt another,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſſiodore, that which is hurt will not riſe up in revenge againſt the other; no more ſhould one man revenge himſelf upon another, unleſs it be for the prevention of ſome greater evil.</hi> They therefore that puniſh Malefactors with Stripes, Baniſhment, or Fines, do it not ſimply out of revenge, but in purſuance of ſome future good that may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ariſe: But it is otherwiſe in God, unto whom <hi>Plato</hi> doth miſapply thoſe Sentences. For the actions of God may be grounded upon his very Right of Sovereignty, eſpecially when they are applyed to ſome ſpecial ſins of men, although they propoſe to themſelves no end beyond themſelves: and thus do ſome of the Hebrews expound that of <hi>Solomon, The Lord hath made all things for themſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> 
                     <hi>even the wicked for the day of wrath;</hi> that is, Even when he puniſheth the wicked, he doth it for no other end, than to ſhew that he can puniſh them; (thus he is ſaid to raiſe up <hi>Pharoah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 14.4. Rom. 9.17.</note> that in him his power may be known.) And although we do admit of the more vulgar Interpretation, it comes to the ſame ſenſe; namely, That God is ſaid to make all things for himſelf, that is, By the right of that ſupereminent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and perfection that is in himſelf, without ſeeking or rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Certainly the Holy Scriptures do teſtifie that God doth ſometimes inflict puniſhment upon ſome notorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents for no other reaſon but to ſhew his power. As when he is ſaid to rejoyce at their calamity, and to mock when their fear cometh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28 63. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.24. Secondly, When in revenge for our fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mer provocations, he is ſaid to harden the heart, and to blind the eyes, and to ſtop the ears, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.10. and thirdly, When in that laſt and great Gaol-Delivery, he adjudgeth them to eternal torments, after which there is no place or hopes of amendment, yea and ſome puniſhments even in this life that are inconſpicuous, ſuch as are obduration and excecation, do clearly evince the truth of that which we object againſt <hi>Plato.</hi> But when one man puniſheth another man whom Nature hath made his Equal, he ought to propoſe ſome end unto hmſelf. And this is it that the School-men ſay, That the mind of him that avengeth an injury, ſhould not acquieſce in the ſufferings of the Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nder. Of the ſame mind alſo were both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca, Ad vindictam veniendum, non quia dulce, ſed quia utile; We ſhould affect revenge, not as it is ſweet, but as it is profitable.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Ariſtotle, Some things are ſimply honeſt, others honeſt out of ſome neceſſity.</hi> And as an example of this latter, he inſerts this of exacting puniſhments, <hi>Exequor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, non quia dolet, ſed quia opportet; I take revenge, not becauſe I ſmart, but becauſe it is convenient.</hi>

                  <head>V. In what ſenſe revenge is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lawful.</head>
                  <p>Thus indeed it ſhould be with men; but for the moſt part it is far otherwiſe, for we pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in revenge, and revenge to aſſwage the grief of our ſufferings. As if <hi>laeſo doloris remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um inimici dolor; our pain were leſſenned by our enemies grief.</hi> So <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, That grief is ſomewhat allayed and mitigated by a juſt revenge. But this proceeds not from the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but from the iraſcible part of the ſoul, being the ſame with us as it is with Brute Beaſts. For anger, as in Beaſts, ſo in men, is nothing elſe but <hi>Aeſtus ſanguinis circa cor, ob appetitum reponendi doloris; An inordinate heat about the heart, out of a vehement deſire of revenging our own grief,</hi> as <hi>Euſtratius</hi> rightly defines it: which appetite is of it ſelf ſo much without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſometimes it miſtakes the true object, and is carried violently againſt thoſe that did no ways hurt us; as when we revenge our ſelves upon the young Whelps for the Bitches ſake that bit us; and ſometimes againſt things altogether without ſence, as when a Dog bites the Staff or Stone wherewith he is beaten. Now <hi>what can be more irrational, quam his iraſci, quae iram nec meruerunt, nec ſentiunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, than to be angry with thoſe things which neither deſerve our anger, nor feel it?</hi> Like the Braſilians, a fierce and brutiſh Nation, who being wounded by a Sword, revenge themſelves, as well on the Sword, as on the Man that weilded it. But this appetite in it ſelf conſidered, agrees not with the rational part of the ſoul, whoſe Office it is to govern the paſſions; nor is it conſonant to the Law of nature, becauſe it thwarts that Principle of rational and ſocial nature, as ſuch which forbid us to do any thing whereby another may be damnified, unleſs it be for ſome greater good. But in the grief or ſufferance of another, barely and in it ſelf conſidered, there is nothing of good, but what is falſe and imaginary; as in ſuperfluous riches, and many other things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And in this ſenſe it is that not only our Chriſtian Doctors, but the ancient Philoſophers, who condemn revenge as unlawful, are to be underſtood. So <hi>Seneca, This word revenge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be uſually taken for a thing that is juſt, yet it is inhumane, and differs nothing from an injury, but in order only. He that retaliates his own grief upon another, hath only this to plead for his ſin, That he was firſt provoked.</hi> Nay, if we will give credit to <hi>Maximus Tyrius, He that revengeth, is ſometimes the greater Sinner of the two; foraſmuch as he that returns an injury hath more of malice, fury, and unbridled paſſion, than he that gave the first occaſion, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done through raſhneſs or ignorance, and againſt a mans will.</hi> Now if ſo, as it is againſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49430:128"/> Nature for the Stream to riſe higher than the Fountain that feeds it; ſo is it moſt unjuſt that the puniſhment ſhould be greater than the offence.

                  <p>Firſt, By putting <hi>him</hi> to death that did the wrong; Secondly, By taking away from him the power to do wrong: Or Thirdly, By deterring him from doing any further wrong by the ſharpneſs of his puniſhment, which is conjoyned with reformation, whereof we have juſt now already diſcourſt.

O Jupiter, that must neceſſarily ariſe out of injuſtice: quouſque progredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur malum, &amp; ubi tandem conſiſtet? how far ſhall this evil proceed, and where ſhall it at length end?</hi> thus likewiſe doth <hi>Ariſtides</hi> argue in his Oration for peace; <hi>who of all the Grecians would be left alive, if to revenge the death of thoſe who are already ſlain, thoſe yet living ſhould wilfully run upon their own ruine?</hi> For prevention of which inevitable miſchief, were (as I have already ſaid) Laws inſtituted, Tribunals erected, and Magiſtrates ordained; yet doth this liberty, that nature gave us at the firſt, remain ſtill in force in ſuch places where no Laws are, or can be executed, as on the Seas and in deſert places; yea, and in divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially amongſt the antient Germans, where almoſt all differences were ended by the Sword; as appears by that of King <hi>Theodorick</hi> in <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> to his Goths: <hi>Break off</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this prodigious cuſtom of ſingle combats, where matters in differenee are much better diſcuſt with words than blows;</hi> and in another place, <hi>what need have we of tongues, if every ſlight quarrel muſt be ended by the Sword?</hi> whither (haply) we may refer that act of <hi>Cajus Caeſar,</hi> who being then a private perſon, did with a tumultuary Fleet purſue and chaſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pyrates by whom he had been formerly taken, diſperſing ſome of their Ships and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others; and when he found the Proconſul negligent in puniſhing the Captives whom he had taken, he himſelf returned to the Sea and commanded them to be hanged: ſo likewiſe is it among the Umbrians, where every man is his own Judge and avenger, which at this preſent is uſually practiſed among the Muſcovites, and that without any reſtraint in ſome ſmall time after their addreſs in vain made to the Judges: from whence alſo before Chriſtian Religion was planted,<note place="margin">Duels whence they aroſe.</note> ſprung the cuſtom of Duels among the Germans, which is not yet ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed. Wherefore the Germans in <hi>Paterculus,</hi> admired when they obſerved the form of the Roman Juriſdiction, whereby all conteſts and injuries were decided in a judicial way; and that that which was uſually before determined by force of Arms, was now decided by Law: the Hebrew Law <hi>permitted the kinſman of him that was murthered to kill the murtherer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The profit that every man indefinitely may receive by the puniſhment of a Malefactor, which is the third end why they are puniſhed, hath as many parts as that which the injured perſon receives by it: for he is ſo puniſhed, either leſt he that hath injured one, ſhould injure another; which may be prevented, either by his death, or by diſabling him from doing the like injury, as by impriſoning him; or ſecondly, by reclaiming him; or thirdly, leſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being encouraged by the hopes of impunity, ſhould be alike injurious unto others, which is the end of all publick puniſhments which are therefore uſed, <hi>ut unius poena metus ſit multorum; that the puniſhment of one, might strike a terrour into many:</hi> Or (as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſpeaks) that others may learn wiſdom and fear. <hi>Polybius</hi> records that he ſaw ſome Lyons crucified for attempting the life of a man, that ſo the reſt for fear of the like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Pliny. lib. 8. c. 16.</note> might be affrighted from committing the like crime. Now the power of executing this right alſo is naturally in every man: thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, <hi>that nature doth deſign a good man to be a perpetual Magiſtrate;</hi> for that man that is eminently juſt and honeſt, is by nature raiſed up and qualified for a Prince,<note place="margin">Vit.

For theſe natural qualifications (as I have often ſaid) infer no right, though they give us a capacity for it. Concerning this natural Right the opinion of <hi>Democritus</hi> was this, <hi>Concerning the killing or not killing of living Creatures, the matter ſtands thus, If thoſe Creatures either do or would hurt us, whoſoever kills them ſhall be innocent; nay, he that kills them, doth much better than he that ſpares them.</hi> And preſently after he ſaith, <hi>As for thoſe Beaſts which unjuſtly annoy us, it is altogether lawful for us to kill them all.</hi> And ſurely it is not improbable that good men before the Flood did live much after this manner, before God had declared his will of converting the reſt of the Beaſts to ſerve a Mans nouriſhment. And by and by he addes, <hi>What we have written of Foxes and other noxious Serpents, the ſame we ſuppoſe may be ſaid of men.</hi> Whereunto he preſently ſubjoins, <hi>Furem &amp; Latronem qui quocunque modo occiderit, ſive manu, ſive juſſu, ſive ſuffragio, innocens eſt; He that kills a Thief or a Murtherer, whether it be with his hand, or by his command or ſuffrage, is to be accounted innocent.</hi> And to theſe places of <hi>Democritus,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Seneca</hi> had ſome reſpect in ſaying,<note place="margin">Sen. de ira l. <hi>1.</hi>

                     <hi>When I command an obſtinate Malefactor to be put to death, I do it with the ſame mind and intent as when I command a noiſom and venemous Beaſt to be killed. Nay, if I ſee a Viper or a Scorpion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philo) though he attempt not to bite or to wound me, yet will I kill him if I can, leſt he ſhould endanger me or ſome others, by that malignity that is in him.

So the ſame <hi>Democritus, The Laws would never reſtrain us from living as we pleaſe, but that it was evident that men went about to wrong one another. For envy is the mother of ſedition.</hi> But yet what is ſaid before of private revenge, the ſame may be here alſo ſaid of publick and exemplary Judgments, namely, That there doth yet remain ſome footſteps of that ancient Right in ſuch places, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch perſons as are not ſubject to publick Judicatories; yea and among ſuch alſo as are ſo ſubject in ſome particular Caſes. As among the Jews it was lawful for any man to kill him immediately who forſook God and his Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.9. Numb. 25. 1 Macc. 2.24, 26.</note> or that ſeduced his Brother to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which the Jews called the judgment of zeal which was firſt exerciſed by <hi>Phineas,</hi> and from him was drawn into a cuſtome.

                  <p>Let us now enquire whether this liberty of puniſhing or revenging an injury be reſtrained by the Goſpel. And ſurely it is no wonder, as we have elſewhere ſaid, that many things
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49430:131"/> that are conſonant to the Law of Nature, and to the Civil Laws, are notwithſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Divine Law, ſeeing that that Law is the moſt perfect of all Laws, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a reward far greater than humane nature, or than can poſſibly be given by any other Law-maker; for the obtaining whereof there are deſervedly required ſuch Vertues as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe commanded by the ſole Law of Nature.<note place="margin">Vide Lactant. de ira Dei, c. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> Thoſe Chaſtiſements that leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them no brand of infamy nor laſting damage, and are neceſſary for certain Ages and Conditions,<note place="margin">Servorum Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orúmque peccata non coercere, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum eſt.</note> as for Children and Servants; are no whit repugnant to the Divine Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, eſpecially if done by ſuch as by humane Laws have a permiſſion ſo to do, as by Parents, Tutors, Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may eaſily be collected from the very nature of the thing it ſelf. For theſe are the Souls Phyſick, altogether as harmleſs as well-tempered Potions, though to the ſenſe as unwelcome. But as to revenge it is otherwiſe: For as it only ſatisfies the mind that is ſenſible of the wrong it ſuffers, it is naturally unlawful, much leſs is it agreeable to this Evangelical Law, as we have already ſhewed. But the Hebrew Law did not only forbid to hate or bear any grudge againſt their Brethren,<note place="margin">Revenge as it proceeds from a delight in the Revenger, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> (that is, againſt their own Country-men) <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. but it commanded them to confer on them ſome common courteſies, though they were their enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. Now our Saviour embowelling this Law, and ſhewing, That under the name of Neighbour all mankind was to be underſtood, doth hereby convince us, That we are not only reſtrained from hurting our enemies, but that we are alſo commanded to do them good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. But yet it was permitted to the Hebrews to revenge ſome great injuries done them, though not by themſelves, yet by their Judges. But the Evangelical Law takes away this licence alſo, as is evident by that oppoſition that he puts between the Law and the Goſpel, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>but I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c. And although the words following do properly appertain to the repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of injuries, which licence they do at leaſt in ſome meaſure reſtrain; yet much more may we think their purpoſe was to prohibit revenge, becauſe they ſeem to be placed in direct oppoſition to that permiſſion which was anciently given them, and ſo to imply a rejection of that licence, as being agreeable only to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s more imperfect Diſcipline: <hi>Not that a juſt revenge was evil,</hi>

                     <hi>and not by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, but by his Neighbour alſo, as appears by another charge given by the ſame Prophet, Zach.</hi> 8.17.<note place="margin">Zach. 8.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Let no man imagine evil againſt his neighbour,</hi> no not <hi>in his heart.</hi> Whence <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> infers, <hi>Multo magis patientiam indixit injuriae, qui indixit oblivionem; He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to forget injuries, doth much more command us to bear them patiently; and he that cleanſeth the heart from thinking evil, doth much more restrain the hands from doing evil: and when he ſaith,</hi> Vengeance is mine, I will repay it, <hi>what doth he but teach us, That we ſhould wait with patience, till God (whoſe Prerogative it is to revenge) will be pleaſed to take our Cauſe into his own hand? And ſeeing that he will not permit us ſo much as to remember injuries, or to imagine evil in our hearts againſt our Neighbour, it is plain, That he doth not require that we ſhould exact an eye inſtead of an eye, or a tooth inſtead of a tooth, by way of revenge; but rather by permitting the ſecond injury, his main ſcope was to repreſs the firſt,</hi> Ut unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque recipiens licentiam ſecundae injuriae, à prima ſemetipſum contineret; <hi>That every man conſidering with himſelf, that whatſoever he doth unto others, he muſt ſuffer the like from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may be the more fearful of doing that wrong which he would not be content to ſuffer. For the Argument, as to men, was more forceable to reſtrain us from doing violence, by ſetting before us the Law of counter-paſſion, than by aſſuring us that he himſelf would avenge it. And yet both theſe flaming ſwords are ſet to reſtrain us from doing wrong,</hi> Ut qui Deo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret, ultionem à Deo expectaret; qui minus fideret, Leges talionis timeret: <hi>That he who believes that God is the Avenger, might fear to offend, leſt God ſhould avenge it; and he who believes not, might yet be afraid of the Laws of men, when he aſſuredly knew, That what wrong ſoever he did unto his neighbour, he ſhould undoubtedly ſuffer either from him or others. Our Saviour's Precept then of ſuffering injuries patiently, and of forbearing revenge, is not inconſiſtent with the Diſcipline of</hi> Moſes, <hi>but rather ſtrengthens and confirms it. And indeed if we look at the reaſon of this ſo perfect and exact patience that is required of us, we ſhall find that there would be but little of equity in the Precept, if it did not proceed from him who is the righteous Judge of the whole Earth, and who hath engaged himſelf by his word and promiſe, That he himſelf will revenge our wrongs. For if he that impoſeth on me this grievous burthen, of not only not returning a blow that is given me, but of offering mine other cheek to the Smiter, and of not only not returning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for reproaches, but of bleſſing thoſe that curſe me; if, I ſay, he that reſtraineth me thus from righting my ſelf, do not right me, in vain doth he command me patience, if he give me not the reward of that patience which is a juſt revenge, which he ought to permit to me, if he do it not himſelf;
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49430:131"/> and if he ſuffer not me to do it, he himſelf is bound to perform it. For</hi> Diſciplinae intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriam vindicari; <hi>It is a neceſſary part of good Diſcipline to help them to right that ſuffer wrong.</hi> And <hi>metu ultionis, omnis refraenatur iniquitas; the fear of a juſt revenge reſtrains all acts of violence.</hi> By this of <hi>Tertullian</hi> we may ſee, That it is not only unlawful for a Chriſtian to exact this Law of retaliation, but that it was not tolerated among the Hebrews as a thing ſimply, and in it ſelf commendable, but only for the prevention of a greater evil. Thus alſo doth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expound that Law of retaliation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> Eph. 4.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore doth Chriſt urge that of</hi> Moſes, <hi>An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</hi> Ut illius manus cohibeat, non ut tuas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citet contra; <hi>To reſtrain him that offers the wrong, not to provoke thee to revenge who ſuffereſt it; not only to preſerve Thine eye, but to keep His alſo ſafe.</hi> That it is not lawful for a Chriſtian to exact this Law out of hatred, nor barely as a puniſhment for that which is paſt, is without all queſtion. The moſt learned amongſt the Hebrews did not apprehend it in that latitude; for they reſpected not ſo much the words of the Law, as the reaſon of it, and the intent of the Law-giver. This appears by the acknowledgment of the Jews of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (as <hi>Philo</hi> tells the Story) who when they beheld the calamities that befel <hi>Flaccus,</hi> who was their bitter enemy, cried out, <hi>Non delectamur, Domine, ultione de inimico,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We delight not, O Lord, in revenge, though on our enemy; for from thy Sacred Laws we have learned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate the man.</hi> And to that end is that general Precept of our Saviour, To forgive every man (without diſtinction) that hath offended us; that is, Neither to do, nor to wiſh them any evil, out of the ſenſe of that evil which they have done unto us;<note place="margin">Matt. 6.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>for he that doth ſo is cruel, arrogating that unto himſelf which is due unto the Laws:</hi> wherefore <hi>Lactantius</hi> reciting thoſe words of <hi>Cicero, Is vir bonus est qui prodeſt quibus poſſit, noceat nemini, niſi laceſſitus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriâ; He is a good man that doth good to whomſoever he can, but hurts none, unleſs provoked by ſome injury;</hi> thus deſcants upon them, <hi>O what a plain and excellent Sentence is here ſpoiled by the addition of two words!</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> reciting the ſame Sentence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſaith, That that Sentence wanted the authority of the holy Goſpel to confirm it, (which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, That to return an injury hath no leſs of evil than to infer one.) But what ſhall we ſay of that revenge which reſpects not the time paſt, but that which is to come? Surely Chriſt commands us to forgive even this alſo, firſt in caſe there appear any ſigns of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the perſon offending, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3.<note place="margin">Luke 17.3.</note> And a plenary remiſſion the Apoſtle requires, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.32. that is, Such a remiſſion as reſtores the Offender into the ſame degree of friendſhip wherein he was before the ſin was committed; whence it follows, That nothing ought to be exacted from him by way of puniſhment. Beſides, though there be no ſuch ſigns of repentance, yet if the damage we ſuſtain be not very great, no greater than the loſs of ones Coat, Chriſt by this Precept reſtrains us from requiring any revenge at all. Of the ſame opinion were both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Maximus Tyrius:</hi> The like doth <hi>Muſonius</hi> profeſs of himſelf, namely, That for ſmall reproaches (as a box on the ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he would neither ſue any man at the Law, nor perſwade any man ſo to do; becauſe ſuch as theſe are much better forgiven or diſſembled. But in caſe we cannot paſs it by without giving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to greater injuries, either to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>XI. The Argument from Gods mercy in the Goſpel, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</head>
                  <p>Yet ſome there are, who in defence of the contrary opinion, do thus plead; that God eſpecially in the new Covenant, doth declare himſelf to be full of mercy and forbearance, which all Chriſtian men, yea even Magiſtrates, as Gods vicegerents ought to imitate; which I grant to be in ſome meaſure true, but not in that large and unlimited ſenſe as they would have it underſtood. For that infinite mercy of God declared in the New Covenant, doth principally reſpect thoſe ſins which are committed againſt the Laws given to <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi> or againſt thoſe Laws given by <hi>Moſes</hi> before the publication of the Goſpel, as will appear, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. For thoſe that are committed after, eſpecially if attended with contumacy and ſtubborneſs, are threatned with Judgments of another nature, much more ſevere than thoſe threatned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.21, 22, 28. Neither are they threatned with Judgments of the other life only, but very often with Judgments of this life, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. Neither doth he at any time indulge pardon to a ſinner, <hi>niſi ipſe de ſe quaſi poenas exigeret; unleſs he that ſins, do as it were inflict puniſhment upon himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. And that with a great deal of ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. But here they farther object, that in imitation of Almighty God, the Magiſtrate ſhould not puniſh thoſe at leaſt that are penitent. But to paſs by that, it will be a difficult thing for the Magiſtrate to diſcern who are truly penitent; for if outward ſhews and profeſſions of penitence would be ſufficient, no man would ſmart for his ſin: we find by the example of King <hi>David,</hi> that God doth not always remit all kinds of puniſhment, no not to the penitent: for though he do remit or abate of the ſeverity of the Law, ſo that he doth not puniſh him with a violent, or otherwiſe untimely death, whereunto his ſin hath ſubjected him; yet whilſt he ſuffers him to be chaſtiſed with the rods of men, it plainly ſhews that his mercy is as well ſeen in the extenuation of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as in the total and abſolute remiſſion of them; <hi>there is much of mercy and lenity in the mitigation of torments, and leſſer judgments deſerve not the name of judgments, when we know that we have deſerved greater:</hi> even ſo, now God may and undoubtedly doth expreſs his mercy to a ſinner, in remitting the puniſhment of eternal death, which every ſinner doth contract for his ſin, though he do viſit him with an untimely death, either immediately by himſelf, or mediately by the hand of the Magiſtrate.</p>

                  <p>But others there are again that urge, that together with the life of a ſinner all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of repentance is quite cut off: whereunto we anſwer, that no man is ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſnatcht away, but he is allotted a certain time to make his peace with God: And although he be not permitted to make a real expreſſion of his converſion, by his life and converſation; yet that God doth ſometimes accept of the will for the deed in ſuch caſes, is moſt apparent by the example of the Thief upon the Croſs.

For if the Laws have regard to the grief and ſorrow of the Offender, it remits the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but not the ſin; as in the Caſe of an Husband that kills his adulterous Wife, or of the Wife her adulterous Husband.

                     <hi>is the remiſſion of puniſhment that is due; but a wiſe man will do his duty, and give unto every man what is his due:</hi> But the fallacy lies in the word <hi>due;</hi> for if by <hi>due,</hi> we mean that which a man may lawfully do without injuring any, then it will not follow, That he that doth not puniſh, doth not that which he ought to do. But if by the word <hi>due,</hi> we underſtand that which we muſt do, then we anſwer, that there is not always ſuch a neceſſity; for in this ſenſe, though the offender be by the Law puniſhable, yet is it not always neceſſary that he ſhould be puniſhed: for thus, the puniſhment is not always due, but lawful only. And this may hold true as well before the penal Law is paſt as after; againſt theſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his fragments argues well,<note place="margin">

                  <head>XXII. The offender may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the penal Law be ordained.</head>
                  <p>The Malefactor may be pardoned before the penal Law be ordained; for doubtleſs he that offends, lies under a puniſhable condition naturally: but yet it follows not that he muſt neceſſarily be puniſhed. For as <hi>Julian</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Euſebia, though ſome there be that deſerve to he treated ill, and puniſhed, yet is there no neceſſity that theſe ſhould be deſtroyed:</hi> Becauſe this depends upon the coherence that there is between that puniſhment, and thoſe ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto puniſhments were ordained: wherefore in caſe Firſt, theſe ends be not of themſelves in a moral eſtimation neceſſary. Or ſecondly, if there occur other ends on the oppoſite part no leſs profitable or neceſſary. Or thirdly, if the ends propoſed by puniſhments, may haply be by ſome other ways obtained; then it is plain that nothing can preciſely oblige us to require puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>As for example, in the firſt caſe, when the offence is ſo privately committed, that few perſons take notice of it, and the publick traduction whereof would be not only unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but haply damagable; were it not better to connive and diſſemble the knowledge of it, and not at all to puniſh it, than by puniſhing it, to make it the more publick (as in the caſe of Scandal?)<note place="margin">Ad.

For then as <hi>Seneca</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Beneficium ſuperveniens apparere injuriam non patitur; we cannot ſee the injury done, for the glory of his preceding merits.</hi> Thirdly, ſometimes again the end that we propoſe to our ſelves in puniſhing, may better be obtained by ſome other ways, as when reproofs will ſerve to reform an offender, what need is there of blows? or when a man is ready to ſatisfie an injury with an ingenious confeſſion, and an humble ſubmiſſion, it is in vain to exact puniſhment; whereunto that wiſe Hebrew had reſpect when he ſaid,<note place="margin">

Very appoſite unto this, is that of <hi>Sopater,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Juſtitiae pars illa quae contractus ad aequalitatem reducit, omnino reſpuit omne gratiae genus: at ea pars quae circa delicta occupatur, non recuſat ſuavem &amp; blandam gratiarium faciem; that that part of juſtice, which weighs all contracts in an equal ballance, utterly rejects all kind of favour: but that which is converſant about offences, refuſeth not ſometimes the meek and lovely face of the graces.</hi>

                     </note> and is as it were the Body of the Commonwealth: For, as ſuch, he may take away even the whole Law; for the nature of an humane Law is ſuch, that it depends upon the will of the Law-maker, not in reſpect of its inſtitution only, but of its continuation.<note place="margin">Humane Laws alterable by him that made them.</note> But in caſe he do ſubvert or take away any Law without ſome probable reaſon or cauſe, he ſins againſt the Rule of Polity.

                  <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it appears, That in puniſhments two things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, Firſt, The merit of the Crime; ſecondly, The profit that redounds by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. As to the former, <hi>Nemo puniendus est ultra meritum, No man ought to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the merit of his offence:</hi> for, as I ſaid before, There ought to be an equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſin and the puniſhment, according to that of <hi>Horace,</hi>

                  <head>XXIX. The impulſive Cauſes of ſin are to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together.</head>
                  <p>In the merit of the crime, three things are to be examined; Firſt, The cauſe that did provoke; Secondly, The cauſe which ought to have reſtrained, and, Thirdly, The fitneſs and capacity of the perſon to either. As to the firſt of theſe, there is, doubtleſs, ſome cauſe that moveth every man to evil. There is hardly any man wicked, but for ſome end; or if there be any man that loves wickedneſs for wickedneſs ſake only, ſurely he is not ſo properly a. man as a Devil. The greateſt part of Mankind are led unto ſin by their affections;<note place="margin">Jam, 1.15.</note> So ſaith St. <hi>James, Luſt conceiveth, and bringeth forth ſin.</hi> Where under this Notion, Luſt or Appetite, I comprehend alſo that vehement deſire of declining every thing that may hurt us, which of all others is the moſt natural, and ſo the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Oft-times a man is almoſt inforced upon a ſin, to avoid ſome preſent danger; as when to avoid death, impriſonment, torment, or extreme poverty, he doth ſome act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or injuſtice, and then the fear of the evil that purſues him ſeems to render his ſin the more excuſable. Whereupon <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> inferrs, <hi>That if a rich man be unjuſt, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves doubly to be puniſhed, in reſpect of what he ſuffers for the like ſin who is oppreſſed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. For before ſuch Judges as have any ſentiments of humanity, the poor mans neceſſity pleads ſtrongly for pardon; whereas they who, ſurfeiting with abundance, ſin merely out of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, can have no excuſe at all for their wickedneſs.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Polybius</hi> excuſe the <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanae,</hi> that to avoid that imminent danger that threatned them, were enforced to break the Articles of their League with the Grecians againſt the Aetolians. The more vehement the temptation is, the more pardonable is the crime. A Woman of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as <hi>Gellius</hi> tells the Story,<note place="margin">Gell. l. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> was convented before Cn. <hi>Dolabella</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning her Husband and his Son at the ſame time. The Fact She confeſs'd, alledging, That She had good cauſe ſo to do; becauſe her Husband and his Son had betrayed and murthered her own Son by a former Husband, being a young man, innocent, and of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular hopes; which Fact was ſo clear that it could not be denied. <hi>Dolabella</hi> calls a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but none durſt paſs Sentence in ſo doubtful a Caſe; for the Womans Fact being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, they thought, ought not to go unpuniſhed, and yet the revenge She took, for the murder of her Son, appeared to be but juſt. In concluſion, <hi>Dolabella</hi> ſent her to <hi>Athens</hi> to be judged by the Areopagites, as being the moſt knowing and experienced Judges of that Age, who upon a full hearing of the Cauſe, adjourned the determination of it for a hundred years; by which means they neither acquitted the Woman of her crime againſt the Laws, nor condemned her, though guilty; becauſe the violence of the temptation pleaded for pardon. <hi>The leſs of provocation a man hath to do evil, the greater is his ſin.</hi> Whence <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> inferrs, <hi>That the ſin of incontinence is greater than that committed through fear, becauſe it is more voluntary; for what a man doth out of fear, is to preſerve himſelf from deſtruction: and in ſuch a Caſe there is a force upon the will.</hi>

                     <hi>But lust is conceived within us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the more of evil, becauſe it hath a larger ſhare of the will.</hi> With whom accords <hi>Philo</hi> upon the Decalogue, <hi>All other vehement perturbations of the mind are occaſioned by the aſſault of ſome outward temptations, which ſeem to happen against our will; only our luſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

All ſins,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, merit not the ſame puniſhment, but thoſe deſerve the greatest which might eaſiest be reſiſted.</hi> Hence it is, that in another place he inferrs, <hi>That the Slanderer is a greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than a Fornicator, a Thief or an Homicide, becauſe theſe may have vehement temptations, but the Slanderer none but his own Will. Men do not deſpiſe a Thief, if he ſteal to ſatisfie his own ſoul when he is hungry; but he that committeth Adultery with a Woman lacketh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: He that doth it deſtroyeth his own ſoul,</hi> Prov. 6.30, 32. All other appetites do tend to ſome good, either real or imaginary; thoſe things that are really good, beſides virtues and their actions which cannot entice unto ſin, (being alwayes at peace among themſelves) are either delectable, as pleaſures; or ſuch as are deſirable in order to things that are delectable, which we call things profitable, as abundance of all outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thoſe that are imaginary only, and not really good, are either the excellency that we think we have above others, as it is ſeparated from virtue and profit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, both which, the more devious from Nature they are, the worſe they are. <hi>(Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalia deſideria finita ſunt, ex falſa opinione naſcentia ubi deſinant non habent; Our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wants</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) are eaſily ſummed up, but thoſe that are grounded upon a falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are infinite.)</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <head>XXX. The Cauſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining from ſin.</head>
                  <p>The general cauſe that ſhould reſtrain us from ſin, is, the injuſtice of the fact: For we ſpeak not here of all ſins, but of thoſe which have reſpect to ſomething without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſinning. Now this injuſtice is ſo much the greater, by how much the damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by done to another is greater. And therefore thoſe are the greateſt injuries that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conſummated, and thoſe the leaſt, which though they have made their progreſs through ſome Acts, yet are not arrived to the utmoſt Act: For which reaſon the covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our neighbours goods, is placed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the rear of the Decalogue, as being a ſin of the loweſt form, or, as it were, but an introduction to ſin, which the farther it goes, the worſe it is. In either of theſe kinds, that is eſteemed the greateſt crime, which diſturbs Common Order, and thereby gives offence to moſt men. After this follow the injuries done to particular perſons: And of theſe the higheſt is, that which touches the life of Man, expreſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> The next is, that injury done to a Mans Family, the foundation whereof is laid in Matrimony, contained in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> The third and laſt are, ſuch as are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Mans private Eſtate, either directly, as by ſtealing; or indirectly, as when by our falſe Teſtimony we prejudice the Right of others. Theſe may be yet more acutely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But it pleaſed Almighty God in the Decalogue to follow this Order. For under the name of Parents, which are Natural Magiſtrates, it is fit that Magiſtrates and other Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Governours ſhould be comprehended, by whoſe Authority Humane Society is maintained. Next unto this follows the Interdiction of Homicide; the Inſtitution of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and the prohibiting of Adultery; then Theft is forbidden, and falſe teſtimonies: and in the laſt place, ſuch ſins as are inconſummate. Neither amongſt thoſe Cauſes that ſhould reſtrain us from ſin, are we to place that ſingle damage only, that is done directly againſt others; but that alſo which is probably conſequent to it; as in firing an houſe, making a breach in the ſea-bank, or in a bulwark wherein the lives and fortunes of many Families are concerned. Moreover that Injuſtice, which we put here as a general cauſe of reſtraining from ſin, is ſometimes aggravated by the addition of another crime; as our impiety to our Parents, our inhumanity to our Kindred, our ingratitude to our Patrons or Benefactors. Again, a ſin is reputed the greater being the oftner committed; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as an habit of evil is far worſe than ſome particular acts of evil. <hi>Once to erre is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable:</hi> but <hi>in iiſdem ſaepius errare emotae est mentis; To daſh often against the ſame ſtone is folly, nay, madneſs; the oftner we offend, the greater puniſhment we deſerve.</hi> And from hence we may collect how far forth that was naturally Righteous, which was uſually done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who before they paſſed ſentence upon a Malefactor,<note place="margin">The <hi>Perſian</hi> Cuſtom.</note> looked back to his former life, and compared it with the preſent Crime he ſtood convicted of; for they thought it unjuſt to take away the life of any man for one evil act, unleſs the whole courſe of his life had been otherwiſe ſinfull. And indeed what <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> ſaith, is very true; <hi>We are not to judge of any perſon by ſome particular acts, but by his continued habits.</hi> (None are to be accounted notoriouſly wicked, but they that have long perſiſted in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of wickedneſs, <hi>Nemo repente fit peſſimus; No man arrives at the heighth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency at the first:</hi> For our innocency leaves us not but by degrees; and boldneſs, that
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:49430:136"/> it may learn not to ſtartle at groſſer villanies, gathers ſtrength and courage by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent committing of leſſer ones.) And yet what <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> ſaid concerning the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens preſent Crimes by their former lives, ought to take place in ſuch only, who being otherwiſe not wicked, have been on a ſudden ſurprized by the ſweetneſs of ſome particular ſin: But not in thoſe who have changed the whole courſe of their former lives. For of theſe God himſelf by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> proclaims,<note place="margin">Chap. 18. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1.</note> that he will have no regard at all to their former deeds; whereunto that of <hi>Thucydides</hi> may very fitly be applyed, <hi>They deſerve doubly to be puniſhed, becauſe they are Apoſtates from goodneſs, and degenerate from Virtue to Vice.</hi> And therefore it was wiſely provided by the Primitive Chriſtians in their cenſures of other mens failings, That no Judgment ſhould paſs barely for the crime committed, but with retroſpection on their fore-paſt lives, and on what followed; as may be ſeen in the Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and others:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotio.</note> So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>Now before we can rightly underſtand how to puniſh, we muſt know the aptneſs and capacity of offenders to apprehend the cauſes which do either excite them to commit, or reſtrain them from committing of ſin: Now this aptneſs or capacity of theirs, we may gueſs at, by either their temperament of body, age, ſex, education, or ſome of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the act. For it will eaſily be granted, that children, women, fools, illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate perſons, and ill educated, cannot ſo well diſtinguiſh between juſt and unjuſt, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unlawful, as they that have more perſpicacity and ingenuity; and that they in whom choler predominates, are prone to anger and revenge, as they alſo that are of a ſanguine complexion are to dalliance; ſo young men are propenſe to one paſſion, old men to another; inſomuch that <hi>Nature ſeems to plead ſomewhat in their excuſe, as to ſuch ſins as are, as it were, congeneal with them,</hi> as was well obſerved by <hi>Andronicus Rhodius: And although it cannot exempt them altogether from puniſhment, yet without doubt it renders the fault the more tolerable.</hi> So the apprehenſion of ſome imminent danger quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a fear, and then we raſhly adventure upon a ſin to avoid that danger: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome ſudden and unexpected injury ſets our hot blood on boiling, and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before reaſon can interpoſe, we attempt a revenge. Theſe are the ſudden irru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of paſſion, and not the deliberate acts of the Will, which certainly are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more excuſable than thoſe which ariſing meerly out of the deſire of pleaſure, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us not ſo violently: And therefore may either be deferred, or admit of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter wherein to delight without injury to any.<note place="margin">De Providentia In Epiſt. ad Gal.</note> So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

As alſo among the Roman Laws it was provided, That he that carried a weapon about him with an intent to kill a man, was to have been puniſhed as though he had done it. And if it be objected, That if the bare attempt be puniſhable with death, ſurely the execution ſhould be more ſeverely puniſhed: I anſwer, that becauſe nothing can be more grievous than death, and becauſe a man can dye but once; therefore we muſt neceſſarily aquieſce in this puniſhment, becauſe we can go no further, unleſs we do ſometimes add thereunto ſome kind of torments, to make death it ſelf the more terrible.</p>

                  <p>Puniſhments are not to be conſidered barely, but with reſpect had to the quality of him that ſuffers them. The ſame mulct or fine that is grievous to a poor man, is no puniſhment at all to the rich: and the Stocks or Pillory, which by the viler ſort of people are ſlighted, are worſe than death it ſelf to the nobler. The Roman Laws did often make uſe of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of perſons and puniſhments; and <hi>Bodine</hi> upon this conſideration did frame a kind of harmoniacal proportion: whereas notwithſtanding indeed, here is but a ſimple equality between the merit and the puniſhment, ſuch as is in numbers, as alſo in all contracts between the things ſold and the money, although the ſame Merchandiſes are worth in ſome places more, and in ſome leſs, as alſo is money according to its either plenty or ſcarcity. But we muſt acknowledge that oft-times among the Romans, this was not done without too great a reſpect had to the perſons and their qualities nothing appertaining to the fact, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſons <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law did exceedingly abhor. And this is, as we have ſaid, the intrinſick valuation of a puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>Which two being ſo dangerous, ought to be provided againſt by ſharp and ſevere Laws; The Hebrew Law did puniſh a Thief more ſeverely for ſtealing Sheep or Oxen out of the field, than out of the houſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1.9.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49430:137"/> was; becauſe Cattle in the field are more eaſily driven away, and therefore had need to be ſecured by the ſeverer Laws.<note place="margin">Orat. pro Roſcio.</note> Thoſe crimes, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> are to be fitted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt puniſhments,<note place="margin">Ea maximè a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadvertenda peccata, quae dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficilimè praeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur.</note> which cannot be prevented without great difficulty. So <hi>Juſtin,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scythians, ſaith,. There was no crime ſo heinous as Theft; becauſe to them who had neither houſes, nor incloſures to ſecure their herds of Cattle, or their flocks of Sheep in, what ſafety could there be, if it were permitted unto them to rob and ſteal? Much like unto that in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Problems, where ſpeaking of ſuch Thieves as frequented Baths, he ſaith, That the Law-giver, conſidering that the owners could not in thoſe places look after their things wiſely, committed them to the ſafegard of ſevere Laws. And accordingly we find that theſe Balneary Thieves were in <hi>Athens</hi> puniſhed with death; if what they there ſtole, were above the value of ten Drachmaes, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> teſtifies againſt <hi>Timocrates.</hi> The Cuſtom of a fact, although it detract ſomewhat from the crime; (for as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks in ſuch a caſe, he gave him his pardon, and that not without reaſon; for though the fact were forbidden by the Law, yet was it commonly committed, and not puniſhed:) yet did it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in ſome ſort, to have been ſeverely puniſhed: Becauſe as <hi>Saturninus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Nimium multis graſſantibus, opus exemplo eſt;</hi> when a ſin begins to ſpread, and Malefactors grow nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, then ſome exemplary puniſhment ſeems neceſſary: (for as an hot-headed Horſe hath need of a ſtrong rein; ſo the more publick and cuſtomary a ſin grows, the ſharper ſhould be the puniſhments to ſuppreſs it.) But the former that is, clemency in acquitting of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders is more to be followed in giving ſentence, and ſhould be our guide in paſſing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the Laws themſelves ought to be ſevere and impartial, yet with due regard had to the time when thoſe Laws or Judgments were made and publiſhed, becauſe the benefit that ariſeth by puniſhments hath reſpect to the univerſality, as all Laws alſo have; but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences do vary, and are not the ſame in every offender, for in ſome, they are greater, and in ſome, leſs</p>

                     </note> whether this were ſufficient ground for a juſt War. But becauſe the Rhodians did not break out into any hoſtile acts, nor had made any publick Decree againſt them; therefore by the advice of <hi>Portius Cato</hi> they were neither admitted as Friends, nor declared againſt as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: But yet this Precedent is not always to be followed, becauſe in ſome Caſes the will which hath proceeded to expreſs it ſelf by ſome Overt Acts (though the internal acts of the mind be exempted from humane Laws) doth contract a kind of guilt, and ſo is obnoxious to puniſhment. <hi>Scelera quoque, quamvis citra exitum ſúbſederunt, puniuntur;</hi>

                     <hi>but they that go about to wrong us, deſerve to be puniſhed.</hi> The Romans thought they had juſt occaſion to make war upon <hi>Perſeus,</hi> unleſs he gave them good ſatisfaction why he made ſuch warlike preparations both by Sea and Land, and had conſulted about making war upon them, though they had not, as then, committed any hoſtile act againſt him.

                  <p>The third Caution is, That we diligently diſtinguiſh between thoſe general maxims of Reaſon that are manifeſt of themſelves, as this, That every man ought to live honeſtly, that is, according to the dictates of Natural Reaſon; and others that are neareſt unto theſe, but ſo manifeſt, that they can admit of no doubting ſuch as this, That we ought not to take away from another that which is his. And between thoſe maximes which are not of themſelves ſo clear, but muſt be collected from thoſe before mentioned by conſequences, whereof ſome are eaſily drawn as this, admitting Matrimony, it follows, That we ought not to commit Adultery, which was ſo generally received, that as <hi>Philo</hi> teſtifies in the life of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> It was every where puniſhed; and <hi>Lactantius</hi> tells us, <hi>That to defile the Marriage-bed was condemned by the Common Law of Nations.</hi> Others, though as true, yet are not ſo manifeſtly true, becauſe our aſſent unto them cannot be gained but by the mediation of three or four conſequences, as this, That that revenge that doth acquieſce in another mans grief is vicious. It is here almoſt as it is in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, wherein ſome things are of the firſt Notion, or next unto the firſt; ſome are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations which are immediately both underſtood and aſſented unto: But ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though true, yet are not ſo evident unto all. Therefore as by the Civil Laws, our ignorance of the Law, or of the true meaning of the Law, doth in part excuſe us: So concerning the Law of Nature, there is the ſame Reaſon, That our weakneſs to collect what was thereby forbidden by ſuch conſequences, or what an ill education hath ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in us, ſhould alſo excuſe us: For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <head>XLIV. Whether War may be made for offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</head>
                  <p>Our propoſed method now guides us to Crimes committed againſt God, and to enquire whether for the puniſhment of ſuch, a War may juſtly be undertaken. <hi>Covarruvius</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles this queſtion at large: But being ſwayed by the Authority of others, he holds, That this punitive Power cannot ſubſiſt but where there is a Juriſdiction properly ſo called, which we have already rejected. Whence it follows, That as in the affairs of the Church, the Biſhops are in ſome meaſure ſaid to take upon them the care of the Univerſal Church, (for ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>It becomes us to watch over the whole body of the Church, whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are diſperſt into ſeveral Provinces;</hi> And again, <hi>There is but one Epiſcopacy, whereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one holds his part entirely:</hi>) So beſides the charge of their particular Dominions, Kings may be ſaid to aſſume the general Care of all Humane Societies. But a better Argument brought by ſuch as deny ſuch a War to be lawfull, is this, That God alone is ſufficient to puniſh ſuch ſins as are committed againſt himſelf; for, <hi>Deorum injuriae Diis Curae, &amp; perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium ſatis habet Deum ultorem; The affronts committed againſt God, God takes care of;</hi> and it <hi>ſufficeth, That God himſelf is the avenger of perjury.</hi> But we muſt obſerve, That ſo it may be ſaid of any other ſins, God without doubt is ſufficiently able to puniſh them, and yet we ſee, That the Laws are juſtly and duly exerciſed upon ſuch offenders by Magiſtrates in all Nations, none diſſenting. But againſt this ſome reply, That thoſe puniſhments are inflicted not ſo much for offences committed againſt God, as becauſe of the damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by done unto men: But on the contrary, It is to be obſerved, That not only thoſe offences which are committed againſt others directly, are puniſhed by Humane Laws; but thoſe alſo which may by conſequence be prejudicial to others, as Self-murder, Sodomy, and the like; for though the principal end and ſcope of Religion be to purchaſe the Grace and Favour of God, yet hath it alſo a very ſtrong influence, and works many notable effects upon Humane Society. <hi>Plato</hi> calls it, <hi>The fortreſs and bulwark of all Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and the very bond of good Diſcipline: Plutarch</hi> calls it, <hi>the cement of all Humane Society, and the very foundation and ground-work of the Legiſlative Power.

                  <p>Every falſe Opinion concerning Religion, ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is dangerous, and if it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with perturbation of mind, moſt pernicious: <hi>But to have one and the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the worſhip of God, and to differ nothing in life and manners from each other doth produce the moſt perfect harmony and agreement amongst men,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifies againſt <hi>Appion.</hi>

Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus</hi> alſo hath an excellent ſentence out of <hi>Pythagoras, That the knowledge of God is both Virtue, Wiſdom, and perfect happineſs.

Again, it is very true what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerve, That as Religion keeps Subjects in due obedience to Kings; ſo it reſtrains the Tyranny of Princes, and begets a great deal of Truſt and Confidence between them and

Laſtly, That God Created the whole frame of Nature, and gave Being to all things, is confeſt by the fourth Commandment; in perpetual memory whereof the Sabbath was inſtituted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he imprinted ſuch an indelible Character of Holineſs, That it is more indiſpenſable than any other Right whatſoever: For if a man did eat of meats forbidden, or tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any other caſe, his puniſhment was left as arbitrary to the Judges; but he that violated this Right was peremptorily to die the death; becauſe he ſeemed thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his belief of the Worlds Creation; <hi>Abnegationem Mundi à Deo creati continebat Sabbathi violatio.</hi> For as he that wrote the Anſwers to the Orthodox very well obſerves, <hi>God did therefore give a greater honour to the ſeventh number than to the rest,</hi>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49430:140"/> theſe things that are made, if we will trace them up in their direct ſeries, will certainly at length bring us to ſomething that was not made, which muſt needs be Eternal, and that is God: but for thoſe that are not able to comprehend the ſtrength of this argument, it may ſuffice to know, That theſe contemplative notions of God have been aſſented unto in all ages, and in all places (ſome few only excepted) and by all perſons, as well gentle as ſimple; as well by thoſe who have been too ſimple and ignorant to deceive others, as by thoſe who have been too wiſe to be deceived by others; which univerſal conſent<note place="margin">Univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> among ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other Laws and opinions, doth evidently witneſs, That this truth was delivered unto us from our firſt parents, and was never yet ſolidly confuted: and even this alone, had we no other ground to aſcertain our perſwaſion, was enough. <hi>Philo</hi> argues this caſe thus,<note place="margin">De unius impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> 
                     <hi>Nothing made by art can come by chance; but the worlds compoſure is done with exquiſite art, therefore it muſt needs be made by one, that is, the moſt perfect of all Artiſts, and that is God.

Much more may this be queſtioned by ſuch as now live ſo many Ages diſtant from that Age wherein they were done, as well as the truth of their Hiſtories, which are as ancient as that is, eſpecially by thoſe who never heard of them before, nor have any of thoſe helps either inward or outward, which are neceſſary to beget Faith. And therefore we ſay, That Faith is not by Nature, but by Grace: and that, as when God gives it, it is not as the reward of any pleading merits; ſo when he denies it, or gives it more ſparingly, it is for Cauſes not indeed unjuſt, though unto us for the moſt part unknown, and ſo not at all puniſhable by humane Laws. To this purpoſe was that Canon of the Toletane Council made, whereby it was decreed, <hi>That no man ſhould be inforced (thenceforth) to Chriſtianity:</hi>

Wherefore, ſince it is not in the power of man to give a reaſon why ſome men do believe, and others not, though both have the ſame outward helps and means; hence it is that we reſolve all ſuch doubts in Gods will, ſaying, <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> Neither is this the manner of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures only, but it is uſual with prophane Authours, who when in doubtful Caſes they find not reaſon ſufficient to inform their judgments, ſupply that defect with a <hi>ſic viſum, Thus it ſeems to be.</hi> The ſecond thing obſervable is, That Chriſt the Authour of the New Law did never intend that any man ſhould be compelled to receive it by temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, or driven thereunto by the fear of them.

For certainly our Chriſtian Doctrine, (conſidered in its ſincerity, without any commixture) contains nothing prejudicial to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, nay that doth not rather advance it, it ſhall ſpeak for it ſelf, and its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall confeſs no leſs. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of the Chriſtians of his time, That they had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves by oath to abſtain from thefts and robberies, and not to break their faith with any man. <hi>Ammianus,</hi> ſpeaking of our Religion ſaith, That it teacheth nothing but what is juſt and merciful. So doth <hi>Arnobius,</hi> treating of Chriſtian Aſſemblies, <hi>Wherein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nothing is heard but what exhorts to humanity, meekneſs, baſhfulneſs, modesty, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and communicating of their goods to all men, as if they were all link'd together by brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love.</hi> And it is the uſual Character that the very Heathen give of it, That it is <hi>Secta nemini moleſta, A Sect of Religion offenſive to none. Zozimus,</hi> though a Pagan, gives this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Chriſtian Faith, That it <hi>is a promiſe and engagement to be free from all crimes, and from all impiety.</hi>

And who they are that partake of other mens ſins, may eaſily be underſtood by what hath been already ſaid above concerning the damage that is occaſioned by an injury done. For by the ſame ways, almoſt, whereby a man is made guilty of that damage, by the ſame may a man be made guilty of another mans ſin: and yet not always where there is an obligation to ſatisfie for the damage, there is the ſame to ſatisfie for the offence; but there only where there is the concurrence of ſome notable malignity: whereas oft-times any offence may ſuffice to oblige a man to ſatisfie for the damage given. He therefore that commands a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act to be done, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Joab</hi> concerning <hi>

                  <head>II. How Princes and States are puniſhable by reaſon of the facts of their Subjects.</head>
                  <p>This will be made clearer by examples. Where offences are but perſonal, there the puniſhment is not to be national. No Community or other Civil Society of men may juſtly be puniſhed for the fault of ſome particular perſons, without either committing or omitting ſome fact or duty of their own, whereunto they were generally obliged. For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well obſerves, <hi>In every Nation thoſe ſins which are committed by particular perſons, are to be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are done in common, as when the whole Body of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled do unanimouſly decree it to be done.</hi> Hence ariſeth that Clauſe uſual in all Leagues, <hi>Si defexerit publico Conſilio, If any thing ſhall be done to the contrary by any publick Decree, then ſhall the League be adjudged as broken.</hi> Thus the Locrians in <hi>Livy</hi> excuſe themſelves to the Roman Senate, ſaying, <hi>That their defection proceeded from ſome ignorant and ill affected people, and not by any publick Order of the Senate.</hi> And the Rhodians in the ſame Senate make their defence by the ſame Argument, diſtinguiſhing between the publick Acts of the City, and the private Acts of ſome particular perſons. <hi>There is no City</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſo well governed but may ſometimes have ſome malignant Citizens ſitting even at the Stern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an unexperienced multitude always.</hi> And if the attempts of every private perſon were ground ſufficient for a juſt war, no City could long ſubſiſt. Thus S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> likewiſe argues, <hi>It was not the common crime of the City, but of ſome ſtrangers and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who do all things rather through raſhneſs and ignorance of the Laws, than by reaſon. Neither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is it juſt that ſo great a City ſhould be deſtroyed for the indiſcretion of ſome few, nor that the innocent ſhould equally ſuffer with the nocent.</hi> So neither are the ſins of Children to be imputed to their Parents, nor Maſters to be puniſhed for the crimes of their Servants, nor others that govern for thoſe whom they govern, unleſs it be for ſome delinquency of their own. Now of thoſe ways or means whereby they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over others may be acceſſary to their ſins, and ſo involv'd in their puniſhments, there are two of ſingular uſe, and require our ſtricteſt diſquiſition. As firſt, By conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence:<note place="margin">1. By Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</note> For he that knows that ſuch a crime will be committed, which he can hinder, and is bound to do it, but doth it not, is guilty of that crime when it is committed. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> argues this Caſe againſt <hi>Piſo,</hi>

                        </gap>y in a Conſul, whether he do himſelf ſtir up the people to ſedition by his own pernicious Laws and wicked Speeches, and ſo diſturb the peace of the Commonwealth, or whether by his connivence he permits others ſo to do.</hi> Par eſt delinquere &amp; delinquentes non prohibere, <hi>It is the ſame thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agapetus</hi> to <hi>Juſtinian) to be wicked our ſelves, and to ſuffer others to be ſo when it lyes in our power to help it. He that ſuffers a Sinner to ſin,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arnobius, adds unto him the ſtrength of confidence.</hi> Of the ſame opinion was <hi>Salvian, He who having a power to prohibit a wicked act, and doth it not, doth in effect command it.</hi> And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> likewiſe, <hi>He that doth not reſiſt and oppoſe himſelf againſt a ſin when he can do it, ſeems to give his conſent unto it.</hi> By the Roman Laws, if a Servant did kill a man with his Maſters knowledge, the main guilt was transferred to his Maſter, as if he himſelf had been the Murtherer. Even ſo he that ſuffers his Bond-ſlave to be proſtituted, when he might reſcue her, was by the ſame Law judged the Proſtitutor. By the Fabian Law, if one Mans Servant with the conſent of his Maſter ſeduced another mans Servant, the Maſter of the Seducer was puniſhed for it. But, as I ſaid before, it is requiſite that beſides the bare knowledg, there be alſo a power and authority ſufficient to reſtrain and hinder the committing of it. And this is that which the Laws intend: for when knowledge is commanded to be puniſhed, it is taken for connivence or toleration; ſo that he ſtands guilty who having a power to forbid the doing of a wicked act, doth it not. And in this Caſe knowledg is taken for that which hath the conſent of the will, and ſo it is to be underſtood as if the fact were committed by his advice and counſel. And therefore as the Maſter is not bound by his Servants crime, though he do know thereof, if that Servant ſhall contemn his Maſters authority, and proclaim himſelf a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and as Parents are not bound by their Childrens crimes, though they know of them, if thoſe Children are not under the power and tuition of their Parents; becauſe neither Maſters nor Parents have any power and authority over them. So on the other ſide, although they had power and authority over them, and ſo might thereby prohibit the doing of ſuch crimes; yet if they knew nothing of their purpoſe and intention to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch acts, they cannot be puniſhed for them. For both theſe muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make one man guilty of another mans crime, knowledge of the ſin committed, and not reſtraining them when it was in their power. All which ariſing from natural equity may by a parity of reaſon be applied to Princes and their Subjects; wherefore <hi>Proclus</hi> upon that of <hi>Heſiod,</hi>
                     <q>Whole Cities ſometimes ſmart for th' crimes of one,</q> aſſigns this as the reaſon, <hi>Becauſe having power they did not restrain him from his wickedneſs.</hi> So in the Grecian Army <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and ſome others being ſubject to a General Council of war,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:49430:143"/> It was deſervedly ſaid,
<q>The Princes errours on their Subjects fall;</q> That is, the Grecians were plagued for the folly of their Princes, becauſe it was in the power of that Council to have compelled <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and the reſt, to have delivered up <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phigenia</hi> to the Prieſt to have been ſacrificed. Thus doth <hi>Cyrillus</hi> expound this matter in his Fifth Book againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> whereupon <hi>Ovid</hi> thus:

                     <hi>The fact</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but by few, we all ſtand accuſed of; and the revenge which is ſtrictly due unto thoſe only that did it, is threatned againſt us all; which we might have avoided had we before expelled them the City. So might we by a timely cutting off from us thoſe parts that were exulcerated, have wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for the ſafety of the whole.</hi> And a little after, <hi>For this very thing, thou art puniſhed and utterly deſtroyed, becauſe thou wert not preſent to reſiſt, becauſe thou didſt not prohibit, becauſe thou didſt not reſtrain their madneſs, that thou didſt not expoſe thy ſelf to danger to preſerve the honour of the Emperour; 'tis true, thou didſt not join with them nor partake of their crime, in this I commend thee, this I take in good part; but becauſe thou didſt not hinder them that did it, for this thou art worthily accuſed. Livy</hi> records that as a good plea which the Vejentes and the Latines made before the Roman Senate, namely, That their Subjects had aided their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without their knowledge: But on the contrary, it was not allowed unto <hi>Teuca</hi> Queen of the Illyrians, when ſhe pleaded that they were her Subjects, and not her ſelf that were the Pirates, for ſhe knew thereof and forbad them not; for it might eaſily be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That of what was ſo frequently and ſo publickly done, no Prince could plead ignorance. <hi>The Laurentine Embaſſadors being aſſaulted by ſome of King</hi> Tatius <hi>his near relations, did complain that the Law of Nations was violated; but</hi> Tatius <hi>favouring his own kindred more than common right, drew the revenge wholly upon himſelf.</hi> And hitherto may that of <hi>Salvian</hi> be properly applyed, <hi>That Sovereign Princes who are able to prohibit the greateſt crimes, do ſeem to approve of them if they permit them to be done. It is ſufficient for private men to keep themſelves upright, but they that are Princes muſt take care that others offend not,</hi>

Popular actions are uſually granted in every City, much leſs have they that full power in ſuch offences, whereby any City, or its Governour is peculiarly wronged: but that, that City or Governour hath likewiſe a right, either for the vindication of his own honour, or for his future ſecurity, either to require the offender to be delivered up unto him, or to require that he be puniſhed by that City wherein he lives, according to the injuries he hath ſuffered by him; and of this right, he is not to be deprived.</p>

                  <p>Seeing that it is neither uſual nor ſafe, for one Prince to permit another to enter into his Dominions, with an Army to demand Delinquents to juſt puniſhment; therefore it is fit that the injured Prince ſhould ſend to him, under whoſe protection the Malefactor reſides, to require that either he would puniſh him himſelf according to his merits, or to deliver him up to the pleaſure of the Prince that is injured; and this is that dedition, whereof we find ſo frequent mention in all Hiſtories.

There may be alſo a communication of Crimes between the whole body of the people, and each particular member thereof; becauſe as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

For as upon individual perſons, the greateſt puniſhment that can be inflicted is death; ſo <hi>the death of a City is deſolation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sup. cap. <hi>9.</hi> ſect. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> which happens when the Body Politick is wholly diſſolved; that is, when all the Laws, Priviledges and other advantages thereof do utterly fail; and by this means every ſingle perſon may of a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen become a ſlave; as the <hi>Thebans</hi> were to <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. Alex.</note> thoſe only excepted that contradicted the decree of diſſolving the Society.

But for private men to loſe their particular Eſtates, through the defaults of the univerſality, without any conſent of theirs, is unjuſt, as <hi>Libanius</hi> very well obſerves in his Oration concerning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochian Sedition.

                  <p>But here we meet with a notable queſtion, whether the puniſhment due for an injury done by the generality of any one City or State, may at any time afterwards be exacted: ſo long as that State, City or Commonwealth doth ſubſiſt, it may: for that which is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due at all times, may at any time be exacted, becauſe the ſame body politick ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, though the individuals ſucceed each to other, as we have elſewhere ſhewed. But yet on the other ſide we muſt note, That ſome things are primarily and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to every Corporation, as to have a publick Treaſury, to have Laws, and the like; others appertain thereunto derivatively only, from thoſe individual perſons that inhabit therein: In which ſenſe a Nation or City may be ſaid to be juſt, valiant, prudent, if moſt or many of the Inhabitants thereof be ſuch; and of this kind are the merits of a City. For that which hath no life, cannot of it ſelf contract any guilt, but a City is ſaid to be guilty, in reſpect of thoſe particular perſons who actually offended; but they being dead, by whom the guilt was deduced to the generality of the People, the guilt dies alſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the obligation to the puniſhment, which without merit cannot conſiſt. Thus <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banius</hi> in his fore-cited Oration, <hi>There is no place left for revenge, where all are dead that gave the offence.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> is highly condemned by <hi>Arrianus,</hi> for his too much cruelty and injuſtice in his revenge taken upon the Perſians, there being no one perſon then living of thoſe who had formerly offended the Grecians.

                  <p>As in the firſt place, we muſt diſtinguiſh between that damage that is purpoſely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly done, and that which comes by conſequence; that I account a wrong directly done, when that is taken away, whereunto a man hath a peculiar right: And that I call a wrong done by conſequence, when a man is deprived of that, which otherwiſe he might have had, that condition ceaſing without which he could have no right or title. An example whereof <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> gives us thus, If by digging a Well in my own ground, I cut off or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſpring that feeds my neighbours Well; the damage he ſuſtaineth, is not occaſioned directly, by any illegal act of mine, but by the lawful uſe of that wherein I had a proper and peculiar right as being mine own. And in another place, There is a great difference between the doing of an injury, and the prohibiting a man to make the profit, which he hath hitherto been permitted to make. And <hi>it is very prepoſterous</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer) <hi>to account our ſelves rich before we have acquired thoſe riches;</hi> As when a Father runneth into a <hi>praemunire</hi> by doing that, for which his eſtate is juſtly confiſcate, his Children may feel the loſs, 'tis true; but the loſs is not properly their puniſhment, becauſe the goods could not properly be accounted theirs, unleſs they had continued to have been their Fathers to the hour of his death: which was well obſerved by <hi>Alphenus,</hi> when he ſaid, The Children indeed do ſuffer through the default of their Father, but that they do not inherit that which ſhould otherwiſe have deſcended unto them, is not properly the Childrens puniſhment, but their Parents: But thoſe goods which accrew unto them, not from their Parents, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from nature, cuſtom, or education, do (notwithſtanding their Fathers fault) remain perfectly theirs. <hi>Cicero</hi> writes that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his Children ſuffered want; nor did he think it unjuſt, that <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Children ſhould do the like: and this he affirms to be an ancient cuſtom, and obſerved in all Cities; which notwithſtanding the later Roman Laws have ſomewhat moderated. So when through the default of the major part, which (as we have ſaid before) repreſents and hath the power of the whole, the whole offends, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account loſeth their civil liberty <hi>(i. e.)</hi> their Walls, Ports, and other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; thoſe particular perſons who were innocent, do indeed bear an equal ſhare in the loſs, but yet in thoſe things only which appertained not unto them, but as they were a part of the whole.</p>

                  <p>Beſides it is to be noted, that ſometimes ſome evil is to be impoſed on a man, or ſome good taken from him by the occaſion of anothers ſin; yet ſo that that ſin is not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of that action, as to the very Right of doing it; as he that paſſeth his word for the debt of another, ſuffers, not by reaſon of the debt, but by reaſon of his ingagement, according to our Proverb, A Surety is a ſure tye. For as he that paſſeth his word for a buyer, is not bound by the purchaſe, but by his own free promiſe: So he that undertakes for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent may ſuffer,<note place="margin">Sponde, noxa praeſto eſt.</note> not for his delinquency, but by reaſon of his vadimony or ſuſception;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:49430:146"/> which as it was in his own free power to do or not to do; ſo being done, it ſhall no leſs oblige him than the offence did the delinquent. Now the ground of this is, the power and freedom that every man hath to oblige himſelf, and therefore the meaſure of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings is not to be taken from the hainouſneſs of anothers fault, but from the power he hath to oblige himſelf: The conſequence whereof is, That no man can juſtly be put to death, by being a ſurety for another, (whoſe crime may happily deſerve death) becauſe no man can juſtly oblige himſelf beyond what is in his power; but this power over a mans life, either to take it away from himſelf, or to oblige another to take it away from him, no man hath: and therefore no man can juſtly be put to death by reaſon of ſuch a vade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And this I hold to be the truer opinion, though it ſeems, that not the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans only, but the Grecians and Hebrews alſo were of another mind, who believed that even the ſureties alſo might juſtly be adjudged to death, as appears by that ancient ſtory of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias.</hi> And by thoſe words of <hi>Reuben</hi> to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi>

Neither doth this power of obliging a mans ſelf extend to mutilation; for no man hath ſuch a power over his bodily members as to cut them off, unleſs it be for the conſervation of the whole body. But whatſoever any man hath a full and abſolute power over, he may engage for another, and if he ſuffer thereby, it is not by way of puniſhment, but by way of equity, which requires that what is promiſed ſhould be performed. Thus a man may forfeit his eſtate, his liberty, his goods, and the like. The ſame almoſt may be ſaid of ſuch things as a man enjoys, either <hi>jure precario,</hi> by entreaty or permiſſion, reſpect being had to the propriety of the thing: Or in his own private right, reſpect being had to that Soveraign Right that every City or State hath over it, for the publick and general ſafety. Now if any of theſe ſhall be taken away by the occaſion of another mans crime, it is not (as I have ſaid before) properly as a puniſhment; but as the execution of that precedent right, which by promiſe was transferred to him that takes it. So when that Beaſt is put to death with whom a man hath had copulation, (as by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was decreed,) it was not by way of puniſhment: foraſmuch as a Beaſt having no Law, cannot be ſaid properly to ſin, and conſequently is not liable to puniſhment; but it is by virtue of that Right and Dominion that men have over Beaſts, to do with them as they pleaſe.</p>

Now though God do ſometimes viſit the ſins of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on their Children, yet is this no warrant for us to do the ſame; neither can there be the ſame reaſon, becauſe of that abſolute Power and Dominion, that he hath over our lives, to take them away at his pleaſure, without any reſpect had unto our ſins; whereas men can have no ſuch power, but what our own crimes give them: and therefore as the ſin, ſo the puniſhment ſhould not be extended beyond our perſons. And therefore the very ſame Law of God doth expreſly in another place forbid, That either the Father ſhould be put to death for the Child, or the Child for the Father, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.16. which ſome of the pious Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did religiouſly obſerve, even in the caſe of Treaſon, as <hi>Amaſias</hi> did; which Law is highly commended both by <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo:</hi> As <hi>Iſocrates</hi> doth the like Law amongſt the Aegyptians, and <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis</hi> the ſame among the Romans. <hi>Neither the ſin nor puniſhment of the Father leaves any guilt at all upon the Children,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> out of <hi>Plato.</hi> For it is juſt that every Fox ſhould pay his own skin unto the fleaer, and that every man ſhould carve out his own fortunes, and no man anſwer for his ſin before God by an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney. <hi>Would any City</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cicero) endure ſuch a Law, that ſhould condemn the Son or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, if the Father only or the Grandfather did offend?</hi> Hence it is that the Roman, Grecian, and Aegyptian Laws do forbid the putting to death of Women with Child, as an act of injuſtice and cruelty.</p>

That therefore our Neighbour, being not reſtrained by any former agreement, builds a Fort in any part of his own Dominions, from whence we may be hereafter annoyed, is no juſt ground for us to make War upon him; becauſe, for prevention we alſo may do the like in any part of our own Territories,<note place="margin">Zonaras. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> or apply our ſelves to other the like remedies, and not by War. Whence we may conclude, That the War made by the Romans againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and that made by <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> againſt <hi>Demetrius,</hi> were unjuſt, unleſs warranted by the acceſs of ſome other cauſe.<note place="margin">The <hi>Cauchi.</hi>
                     </note> I am very well ſatisfied with that of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> concerning the <hi>Cauchi,</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt People of all <hi>Germany, Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſupported their grandeur by juſtice, without any extraordinary affectation, either of glory, or riches, and yet without any diſability or want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to either: they lived quietly and without noiſe, provoked no Wars, nor were they waſted by ſpoil or pillage;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Though our own uncertain fears be no ſufficient ground for us to make War, yet may we uſe all lawful means cautiouſly to prevent dangers before they fall; this is that prudence that Chriſt commands to his Diſciples, where he bids them to be wiſe as Serpents, but innocent as Doves. And this is the prudence of Empires, that if any one would annoy us, to take ſuch care, and to uſe ſuch means that he ſhall not be able to hurt us; which may be done two ways: As firſt, if the neighbouring Nations do ſee the growing power of any one Prince, ſo as to conceive ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of him, they ought to combine in a ſtronger League; that if either ſhall be invaded unjuſtly, they ſhall all make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Aggreſſor, this being then a juſt cauſe of War. Thus the Italians being jealous of the Venetians power leagued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their own defence; ſo that though that Republick was too ſtrong for any of them ſingly, yet being far too weak for them all, it was wiſely kept within its own bounds. <hi>Livy</hi> diſcourſing of the ſeveral opinions of men, concerning the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Perſeus</hi> and the Romans, ſome wiſhing well to one, and ſome to another, tells us; That the beſt and wiſeſt ſort wiſhed the victory to neither; for ſo ſhould they live free and ſecure from both. For if either of the two parties ſhould offer to opreſs them, the other would be ready to ſecure them. And as <hi>Spain</hi> formerly, ſo <hi>France</hi> now, aſpiring to act univerſal Monarchy, all European Princes have reaſon to be jealous of him, and to combine together to withſtand him. Secondly if any Potentate being more powerful than his Neighbours, ſhall unjuſtly oppreſs any of them, the reſt ought to confederate, and to compel the Aggreſſor to accept of due ſatisfaction, if there be cauſe for it; which if he refuſe, his cauſe then being unjuſt, (much more if it were originally ſo) they may all of them make War upon him, as being the diſturber of the publick peace. Thus did the Italian Princes againſt the French when they were invaded by <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, which occaſioned the late Triple League or Alliance, when the French had ſeized upon the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and invaded <hi>Flanders;</hi> both which belonged to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and which was the main demonſtration of their valour and ſtrength, the credit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem they had before others, they got not by injuries and oppreſſions: every man amongſt them had his Arms in readineſs, and if occaſion required they had an Army, both of Men and Horſe they had good ſtore; and thus they kept up the repute of being a warlike Nation, though they lived in Peace.</hi>

                  <p>And hereof alſo I ſhall give my advice, and that not in vain, (but becauſe I foreſee, by comparing theſe modern times with thoſe long ſince paſt; much miſchiefs likely to enſue, unleſs in time carefully prevented) that the hopes we conceive that ſome things are due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by our own interpretation of ſome Divine Prophecies, can be no cauſe of a juſt War. (<hi>Zozimus</hi> records it of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> the Son of <hi>Pruſias,</hi> that miſ-appling a Prophecy of one of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> by the perſwaſion of <hi>Attalus</hi> made War againſt his own Father; the like he and <hi>Ammianus</hi> relates of one <hi>Theodorus;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Procopius</hi> of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>

                     </gap>eing that God permits ſuch things as he predicts to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought to paſs, by wicked men and by wicked actions: For the Books of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſhut and ſealed up until a certain time, ſo that they cannot be underſtood, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4.8.9. The Viſion that the Prophet <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> ſaw concerning the judgments to fall on the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> was not immediately to be inflicted on them, <hi>But it was to be fulfilled in its appointed time; In the end whereof,</hi> ſaith that viſion, <hi>it ſhall ſpeak and not lye though it do tarry:</hi> yet was the Prophet <hi>to wait for it, for it ſhall ſurely come to paſs and not ſtay,</hi> Hab. 2.3.

                     <hi>Jerome</hi> upon that place of <hi>Daniel</hi> before-recited writes thus, <hi>If the Prophet did hear and not underſtand, what will they do who preſuming on their own underſtanding, have publiſhed this Book which is ſealed up, and until the time come for its accompliſhment.</hi> So <hi>Procopius</hi> concerning the Oracles of the <hi>Sibyls, Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are beyond all humane power to unfold, until the time come when they ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> Let Divines therefore take heed how they undertake to unriddle Prophecies; and let Politicians beware how they give credit to over-arrogating Divines, though the things predicted were certainly to come to paſs; yet are the times and means when and whereby they are to be accompliſhed very uncertain: and therefore it is no diſhonour to profeſs our ignorance of them, <hi>Eorum quae ſcire nec datur, nec fas eſt, docta eſt ignorantia, ſcientiae appetus inſaniae ſpecies; Some kind of madneſs it is to deſire to know thoſe things, which are therefore ſcreened from us that we ſhould not know them.

                  <p>Thus alſo is it to be obſerved, that in caſe any thing be owing to a man, not ſtrictly out of juſtice, but ariſing from ſome other vertue; as from liberality, favour, mercy, love, or the like, as it cannot be recovered by any courſe of Law, ſo neither can it be required by War.

So <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was of opinion that the <hi>Phocenſes</hi> were deſervedly deſtroyed; but withall he condemned King <hi>Philip</hi> for deſtroying them, becauſe he did it, not upon the ſcore of Religion as he pretended: but out of an Ambitious deſire to enlarge his Empire. <hi>Saluſt</hi> aſcribes <hi>all Wars to this one, and that very ancient cauſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a vehement thirſt after Dominion and Riches.</hi> And it was <hi>Tacitus</hi> his obſervation, <hi>That Gold and Wealth were ever the principal cauſes of making War;</hi> which <hi>Seneca</hi> attributes to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Revenge,

                  <p>But to know theſe things rightly, there is required much knowledge and experience; and if either of theſe be wanting, whereby the judgment may be rightly informed to act by it ſelf, then are we bound to ſteer our affairs by the advice and counſel of the moſt judicious. For that, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is moſt probable which is approved of by all, or by the moſt, or certainly by wiſe men; and of theſe, by either all, or by the greateſt part, or by the moſt prudent and judicious of them: And by theſe means do Kings, who have no leiſure to be eminently learned, grow notwithſtanding wiſe by the counſel of others:
<q>Thus Princes by their Senators grow wiſe.</q> Thus <hi>Ariſtides</hi> in his Oration for Peace tells the <hi>Rhodians, As in matters of fact, that which is atteſted by the moſt authentick and judicious witneſſes is held for truth: So in matters of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, thoſe counſels are ſafeſt, which are approved of by men of the greateſt learning and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi> The ancient Romans never made War without conſulting the Colledge of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49430:152"/> which conſiſted of men of the greateſt Experience in matters of War; neither did the Chriſtian Emperours uſually undertake a War without conſulting their Biſhops, That ſo if any thing could be objected againſt it in point of Religion,<note place="margin">And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great, That he admitted into his Council men of the greateſt Learning, but moſt eſpecially Hiſtorians.</note> they might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of it.</p>

                  <p>But in many Controverſies it falls out, That the Arguments on both ſides, as well from our own Reaſon, as from Authority, are ſo equally probable, that it is very difficult to judge where the Right is: And in ſuch a caſe, if the matter in queſtion be of no great moment, the judgment may be blameleſs, though it paſs on either ſide. But if it be of great concernment, as in paſſing ſentence of life and death upon a ſuppoſed offender, then by reaſon of the vaſt diſtance that there is between the parts eligible, that part is to be adjudged beſt, that is ſafeſt. And therefore <hi>it is much better to abſolve the Guilty, than to condemn the Innocent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and he adds this reaſon, <hi>For where the caſe is dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>

                     <hi>we ſhould chuſe that part which will infer the leaſt danger in caſe we ſhould err.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Antiphon, If we must needs run the hazard of misjudging, it is more pious unrighteouſly to pardon, than injuriouſly to condemn, for by the former we can be charged but with errour; but by the latter, with wickedneſs.</hi>

                  <p>To make War is a matter of the greateſt conſequence that can concern a Nation, whence enſues a torrent of miſchiefs (as by a Sea-breach) whereby many thouſands of innocent people are on both ſides deſtroyed: And therefore amongſt all our conſultations the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt counſels are thoſe that incline unto Peace.

                     <hi>The firſt whereof is by Treaty or Conference:</hi> Seeing there are two wayes of debating dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, <hi>ſaith</hi> Cicero, The one by argument, the other by plain force; <hi>whereof that is proper to men, this to beaſts:</hi> we may make the latter our refuge, if we cannot receive ſatisfaction by the former. <hi>This is the method which</hi> Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis <hi>preſcribes; not over-haſtily to fly to blows, till we have tryed how words will prevail:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>All means unarm'd, wiſe men will first aſſay,</l>

                     </q> 
                     <hi>So</hi> Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis, We must not proceed to blows, untill we have tryed what words can do: <hi>Agreeable whereunto is that of</hi> Menelaus <hi>in</hi> Libanius, It more becomes a man to make tryal how he can prevail with Reaſon and Arguments, before he raſhly ruſh into War. <hi>So alſo</hi> Menelaus <hi>in</hi> Libanius, It is more agreeable to Humane Nature, to try, how far we can prevail with Reaſon, than ſuddenly to fly into arms: <hi>The like we find in</hi> Euripides;
<q>This I'le obtain by words, if not, by blows.</q> 
                     <hi>Thus</hi> Paneas <hi>in</hi> Livy, There are, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> many things, which men rather than make War, are willing to remit; which notwithſtanding cannot be enforced from them by force of arms. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius <hi>in</hi> Herodotus <hi>blames the Grecians upon this account,</hi> That being all of one Language, they did not first argue their grievances by the mediation of Heraulds and Ambaſſadors before they broke out into Arms. <hi>So</hi> Coriolanus <hi>in</hi> Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis, If a man, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> without coveting anothers, do but demand his own, and being thereof denied, ſhall make War; that War, by the conſent of all Nations is most just. <hi>For as King</hi> Tullus <hi>ſaith in the ſame Author,</hi> Quae verbis componi nequeunt, ea armis decernenda ſunt; Thoſe differences which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by reaſons be compoſed, must be determined by blows: <hi>And yet, as</hi> Vologeſes <hi>in</hi> Tacitus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,</hi> I had rather keep what mine Anceſtors have left me by Equity, than by the expence of blood; by mine own Juſt Title, than by a doubtfull War. <hi>For as King</hi> Theodorick <hi>wiſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> Then only is War profitable, when our Enemies will not otherwiſe do us Juſtice.</p>

                  <p>THough it be not properly pertinent to our purpoſe in treating only of the Rights of War, to ſhew how far other Virtues do either enjoyn or perſwade thereunto, yet will it not be altogether impertinent for preventing of miſtakes, to give ſome cautions about it, leſt any man ſhould think, that whenſoever he hath a Juſt Cauſe offered him, he is bound to make War, or at leaſt, that it is at all times lawfull for him ſo to do: whereas on the contrary, it is, (for the moſt part) much more pious to remit ſomewhat of our Right, than to endeavour to defend it by a dangerous War. We Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are eſpecially taught to expoſe our own lives to the greateſt perils that can be, to preſerve the lives, and (as much as in us lies) to procure the everlaſting welfare of others, in imitation of our great Lord and Maſter, who laid down his own life to ſave ours, even then when we were ſtrangers, nay, enemies unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. How much more reaſon have we to forbear the proſecution of our Juſt Rights, when they cannot be obtained without the effuſion of ſo much Chriſtian blood, and the deſtruction of ſo many mens Lives and Eſtates,<note place="margin">Pol. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Rhet. ad Alex. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> beſides other miſchiefs, which War uſually brings with it? This we are forewarn'd of by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Polybius,</hi> not for every ſuch cauſe to run the hazard of a War. <hi>For the neceſſary defence of our Liberties, our Wives and Children, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make War,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gallio</hi> in <hi>Seneca; but not for ſuch things as are either ſuperfluous, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt,</hi>

And if Chriſt did enjoin us to part with our Coat, rather than to contend for our Cloak, certainly he would have us to neglect much greater loſſes, rather than go to War; becauſe there is no conteſt ſo deſtructive as War.

Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Numa</hi> tells us, That after the Colledge of Heraulds had judged that they might lawfully make War, the Senate conſulted, whether it were fit and expedient for them ſo to do.

                  <head>V. Prudent Rules about our choice of Good.</head>
                  <p>The things that uſually fall under conſultation, are either about the intermediate ends which may probably conduce to the laſt end we fully reſolve on, or about thoſe means
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:49430:155"/> whereby we may probably obtain thoſe ends: The end we propoſe to our ſelves is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either ſome good, or doubtleſs the avoiding of ſome evil, which alſo falls under the notion of good. But thoſe things that lead us hither or thither, are not expetible for themſelves, but as they conduce to thoſe ends: wherefore in all our Conſultations we are to compare both thoſe ends between themſelves, and the effective power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of thoſe things which lead to the end to produce that end. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, <hi>The arguments that excite us to action are of two ſorts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De motione ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium.</note> 
                     <hi>either they are drawn from the goodneſs of the end, or from the poſſibility of obtaining it;</hi> which compariſon hath theſe three Rules, whereby we may be guided: Firſt,<note place="margin">Three Rules to guide us in the choice of Good.</note> If the thing in debate ſeem to have (in a moral eſteem) an equal efficacy to good and to evil; then if the good we hope for have ſomewhat more of good than the evil we fear hath of evil, we may adventure upon the action, (but if the conveniencies be not able to over-ballance the inconvenience, it is better to refrain;) for a wiſe man, though never ſo daring and magnanimous, will not run the hazard of his life for every cauſe; but then only when the reward is great, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honourable. The ſecond Rule is this, If the Good and Evil ſeem to be equal which may proceed from the thing in queſtion, then we may thus guide our choice; if the thing it ſelf have a greater efficacy to produce the Good than it hath to produce the Evil, then we may chuſe it. Thirdly, If both the Good and Evil ſeem unequal, and the power or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the things no leſs unequal; then that thing is at length to be choſen, if its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Good be greater, being compared with its efficacy unto the Evil, than the Evil it ſelf is, being compared with the Good: or if the Good it ſelf compared with the Evil be greater, than its efficacy unto Evil being compared with the Good. Thus <hi>Narſes</hi> to <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius, Where the dangers appear to be equal, and the damage alike if we err,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Procopius Goth. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>there much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and conſultation is neceſſary before we determine the matter in queſtion; but where the difficulties are unequal, and the damages upon miſtake greater or leſs than the hopes of gain, there the choice is very eaſie, and requires no great depth of judgment to determine.</hi> What we have ſet down here ſomewhat more accurately, <hi>Cicero</hi> hath in a plainer way,<note place="margin">De Offic. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> but to the ſame purpoſe deſcribed, where he adviſeth us not to expoſe our ſelves to dangers without cauſe, than which nothing can argue a more fool-hardineſs: Wherefore in perillous caſes we ſhould imitate Phyſicians, who in light diſtempers uſe gentle remedies; but when the diſeaſe threatens death, then thoſe that are more doubtfull and dangerous: Therefore it is the office of a wiſe man to help in a time of danger, eſpecially when he ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conceives, that the good he ſhall reap by it, if it ſucceed, doth over-ballance the damage that he fears if it miſcarry. But as the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> elſewhere ſaith, <hi>No prudent man will endanger himſelf in ſuch an enterpriſe, wherein the good ſucceſs ſhall bring him little profit, but where the leaſt miſcarriage may prove fatal.</hi> For as <hi>Dion Pruſaeenſis</hi> ſaith, <hi>Grant that our grievances be unjuſt and unworthy to be born, yet will it not follow, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ſuffer any thing unjuſtly, we ought by ſtriving against it, to make our condition worſe. To make uſe of iron and ſteel, when more gentle remedies may prevail,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> 
                     <hi>or where the caſe is not extreamly dangerous, becomes neither a skilfull Phyſician, nor a Politick Stateſman.</hi> Dion Pruſaeenſis, <hi>When our burthens are beyond our ſtrength, our endeavours to eaſe our ſelves of them are just and honest, becauſe neceſſary; but if they are tolerable, and that we have cauſe to fear, that by ſtruggling they may be made worſe, we must arm our ſelves with patience.</hi> For as <hi>Ariſtides</hi>

                     </q> It is not ſo properly a love to liberty, as a prepoſterous itch after vain Glory, that makes a man to prefer his freedom before his life. <hi>Cicero</hi> inſtances this as a caſe of neceſſity, that the Ciſilinenſes were neceſſarily to give themſelves up to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> although this clauſe were added to that neceſſity, <hi>Niſi malint fame perire; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs they had rather periſh by famine.</hi> For as <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> apoligizeth for his ſurrender of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> being thereunto conſtrained for want of Bread, <hi>Pugnandum eſt hominibus in homines, non in rerum naturam; Men ought to fight against men, but not againſt nature; neither do men commend a voluntary death, ſo long as their hopes are above their fears.</hi> That ſentence which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> paſt againſt the Thebans, which lived in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, ſtands yet upon record, namely, <hi>That they were the authors of their own ruine; for as much as they had with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than prudence provoked</hi> Alexander <hi>to their own destruction.</hi> And in another place, the ſame Author examining the ground of that War, which the Thracians undertook againſt <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army, after his death, ſaith, <hi>That in the opinion of the wiſest men, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted well for their own glory, but not ſo well for their own profit, by thruſting themſelves over-haſtily into ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, being no ways urged thereunto by any neceſſity; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being forewarned by the deſtruction of the Thebans.</hi> The like cenſure doth <hi>Plutarch</hi> paſs upon <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio, Whom, for refuſing to ſubmit to</hi> Caeſar <hi>after his victory in</hi> Pharſalia, <hi>he condemns, as being the cauſe that ſo many, and ſo gallant men, did unneceſſarily periſh in</hi> Africa.

For he there brings in a ſtory of a certain Band of Italian Foot, whom he deſervedly condemns for deſerting <hi>Pompey</hi> before his Caſe was deſperate, upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s promiſe of ſafety and protection which he condemns, and that not unworthily. But whether an innocent Citizen may be delivered up into the enemies power to preſerve his City from imminent ruine, is much diſputed now amongſt the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it formerly was, when <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> invented that notable Apologue of the Wolves, who were content to make peace with the ſheep, upon condition that their Dogs might be delivered up unto them. Neither doth <hi>Vaſquius</hi> only deny this, but <hi>Sotus</hi> alſo, whoſe Opinion <hi>Vaſquius</hi> condemns, as being too near a neighbour to treachery: Yet <hi>Sotus</hi> was of Opinion, that ſuch a Citizen ought to deliver up himſelf; which <hi>Vaſquius</hi> denies, being ſwayed by this reaſon, becauſe the nature of a Civil Society, which was at the firſt entred into for mutual preſervation, doth not permit it. But the force of this argument reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no farther than this, That no Citizen is bound ſo to do by any right ſtrictly taken; but it argues not, That if he do it, he tranſgreſſeth the rules of Charity: For there are many Duties, which though not by the ſtrict rules of Juſtice, yet by the bonds of Charity we ſtand obliged to perform, which are not only laudable being done, (as <hi>Vaſquius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth) but which cannot be left undone without blame; whereof this is one, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man prefers the ſafety of an innocent multitude before his own. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>that it is better,</hi> that is, leſs evil, <hi>that one man ſhould die, than that the whole Nation ſhould periſh.</hi> For the deſtruction of no one Family can equal the deſtruction of the Univerſe.

This <hi>Sotus</hi> denies, by the example of a rich man, that is bound by the bonds of mercy and charity to adminiſter to the neceſſities of the poor, yet cannot be compelled thereunto. But we muſt here note, that there is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the parts compared between themſelves, as there is for the Superiors compared with thoſe that are ſubject unto them: for equals cannot compel one another, unleſs it be to ſuch things as are ſtrictly due; whereas it is in the power of Superiors, as Superiors, to enforce their inferiors to any virtuous act for the publick good. So we read, that the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> ordained a puniſhment againſt Prodigality, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> againſt Ingratitude, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lucans</hi> both againſt Idleneſs. As in a time of dearth, any one Citizen may be enforced to produce his private ſtore of Grain, and to make it publick: So in this caſe, whatſoever Charity requires of us, the Magiſtrate for a more univerſal good hath a power to enforce; as <hi>Phocion</hi> would have delivered up his friend <hi>Nicocles</hi> had <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded him.</p>

Arb.</note> 
                     <hi>There is not the ſame reaſon, that becauſe it is an Argument of ſome mens goodneſs, to confer courteſies on ſtrangers; therefore it ſhould be the like argument of their justice, to puniſh thoſe that belong to anothers juriſdiction.</hi> But rather as <hi>Procopius</hi> hath it, <hi>It is more agreeable to the rules of equity, that every man ſhould carefully govern his own Province, and not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the affairs of others:</hi> Yet are all theſe to be underſtood of ſuch caſes, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans Subjects have manifeſtly offended, or at leaſt whereof it is doubtful whether they have or not; for to this end were Empires at firſt diſtributed: But they hold not in caſe Subjects apparently groan under ſuch Tyrannies, as no juſt man can approve of; and therefore are precluded from thoſe Rights that are common to humane Society. For in ſuch a caſe as this it was that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made War againſt <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Licinius;</hi> and other Roman Emperours againſt the Perſians, or at leaſt threatned ſo to do, unleſs they protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from oppreſſion ſuch of their Subjects as were Chriſtians, being perſecuted for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe but that of Religion. Yea, and although we ſhould grant that Subjects could not
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49430:159"/> juſtly taken up Arms againſt their Prince; no, not in caſe of greateſt neceſſity (which we ſee is doubted, even by thoſe, whoſe purpoſe it was to defend the Regal Power): Yet will it not thence follow, That other Princes may not take Arms in their own defence. For whenſoever the impediment to any action is meerly perſonal, and not drawn from the thing it ſelf, then that which is unlawful for one to do by himſelf, may yet be lawful for another to do for him,<note place="margin">☞</note> if the matter be ſuch wherein one man may profit another: So a ſuit at Law which a Pupil, by reaſon of his minority cannot maintain by himſelf, his Tutor or Guardian may maintain for him. So a Client that cannot appear in his own perſon by reaſon of the diſtance of place, may notwithſtanding appear by his Attorney. Now that impediment which in a Subject hinders reſiſtance, ariſeth not from the Cauſe which is the ſame in Subjects, as in thoſe that are not; but from the condition or quality of the perſon, which paſſeth not into another. Thus thought <hi>Seneca, He that being ſeparated from my countrey is vexatious to his own, may be juſtly by me invaded,</hi> as I have ſhewed before where we treated of puniſhments; which thing is often conjoined with the defence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents. Although we are not ignorant by thoſe many examples we find in Hiſtories, both ancient and modern, That Ambition, and an inſatiable thirſt after Gain, do too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſguiſe themſelves under ſuch ſpecious pretences; yet may we not thence conclude, That becauſe wicked men do ſometimes uſurp this Right for ſiniſter ends; therefore to defend other mens Subjects from manifeſt oppreſſion, ceaſeth to be lawful. For, <hi>Navigant &amp; Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratae, ferro utuntur &amp; Latrones; Pyrates we ſee navigate the Seas, and Thieves wear ſwords:</hi> yet no man will hence infer, That it is not therefore lawful for Merchants to traffick by Sea, or for Princes to make uſe of Arms to defend their Subjects.</p>

                     <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> approves not of this opinion, <hi>That a Father is in all things to be obeyed.

As if a Father command his Son to give his ſuffrage, or to paſs a ſentence contrary to his own judgment, or to bear witneſs to that whereof he is ignorant. If my Father command me to burn the Capitol, to poſſeſs my ſelf of ſuch a Fort or Caſtle; I may lawfully anſwer, Theſe things I must not do.</hi> So in another place, <hi>We are not to execute all our Parents Commands, for otherwiſe nothing would be more deſtructive than benefits received, if they oblige us unto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſervitude.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Seneca, Neither can we command all things, nor can our ſervants be compelled to obey us in all our Commands:</hi> Contra Rempublicam Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata non facient, <hi>They will not obey us if we command them any thing againſt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; they will not, though commanded, put their hands to any wickedneſs.</hi> Of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was <hi>Sopater, A Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is indeed to be obeyed, if his Commands be according to Law, it is true; but if otherwiſe, it is not convenient.</hi> To juſtifie Subjects for refuſing to execute the wicked Commands of their Princes, we have divers examples in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Stories. <hi>Saul</hi> commanded his Guards to fall upon the Prieſts at <hi>Nob, but they would not put forth their hands to fall upon the Prieſts of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Ahab</hi> at the inſtigation of <hi>Jezebel</hi> perſecuted the Lords Prophets to death; but <hi>good Obadiah pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a hundred of them, and fed them by fifty in a Cave,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Captain and his Fifty to apprehend <hi>Elijah,</hi> only for pronouncing that Sentence which God paſſed againſt him; <hi>Elijah</hi> not only refuſeth to come down, but to vindicate his Commiſſion, <hi>commands fire from Heaven to conſume the Meſſengers,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.10. In our Chriſtian Stories we find <hi>Manuel</hi> and <hi>Georgius</hi> highly commended, for refuſing to be inſtrumental in the murder of <hi>Auguſta.</hi> And in Prophane, we have likewiſe two notable Examples of ſuch who have refuſed to obey their Princes in their unlawful Commands; the one of <hi>Papinianus,</hi> that great Lawyer, who being commanded by <hi>Caracalla</hi> to juſtifie as well to the Senate as the people, the Paracide he had committed upon his own Brother <hi>Geta,</hi>

For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Plus caeditur qui jubet, quando nec obſequitur qui excuſatur; Surely he that commands things unjuſt is ſeverely puniſhable, when he that but executes them cannot be excuſed.</hi> Thoſe Civil Laws which do eaſily pardon venial ſins, are alſo very favourable to thoſe who are inforced either to ſin, or to diſobey; and yet they are not favourable to all alike. For where the crimes are foul, and ſuch as Nature by a ſecret inſtinct ſeems to abhor, they ſhew no favour at all. But where the offence appears not to be heinous, by any natural interpretation, but by Logical inferences may be proved to be ſo, there they wiſely vouchſafe pardon. <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates, <hi>That the Jews that ſerved under</hi> Alexander the Great <hi>could neither by ſtripes, nor any reproachful words, be inforced to carry Earth, or other materials, as the reſt of the Souldiers did, towards the repair of the Temple of</hi> Belus, <hi>which was in</hi> Babylon. But examples more pertinent to our purpoſe are the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean Legion, whereof we have already ſpoken; and the Souldiers that ſerved under <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> whereof S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Though the Emperour</hi> Julian <hi>were an Apoſtate, yet had he many Chriſtians that ſerved under him; to whom if had ſaid, Draw out for the defence of the Commonwealth, they would inſtantly have obeyed; but if he ſhould have ſaid, March out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians,</hi> tunc agnoſcebant Imperatorem Coeli, <hi>then they would have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no King but the King of Heaven.</hi> The like we read of thoſe Executioners, who being converted to Chriſtianity, choſe rather to dye themſelves than to execute the Sentence of death pronounced againſt Chriſtians. Now the Caſe is the very ſame, whenſoever any man is perſwaded that the thing commanded is unjuſt; for to ſuch a man it is ſo long unjuſt, until he can be convinced that it is otherwiſe.</p>

                     <hi>If a Souldier under lawful Command ſhall in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto kill a man, by the Laws of his City he is free from murther; nay, unleſs he do it, he ſhall be held as a Traitor to his own Country. But if he ſhall do it of his own accord, or without command, he ſhall be guilty of murder. That very Law that will puniſh him if he do it without command, will likewiſe puniſh him if he do it not being commanded.</hi> And from hence ariſeth that ſo generally received opinion, I mean as to Subjects, That a War may be juſt on both ſides; that is, in reſpect of them it may be on both ſides void of injuſtice, whereunto the Poet had reſpect when he ſaid,

                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:49430:161"/> Yet is not this opinion ſo generally received, but that it meets with ſome difficulty. For Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> defended the contrary; which may be confirmed not by that Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely which he urgeth, but by this, which ſeems to be more forcible, namely, That he that doubts contemplatively, ought in his active judgment to chuſe the ſafer part, which is, To abſtain from War. The <hi>Eſſeni</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Eſſeni.</hi>
                     </note> are highly commended, for <hi>that amongst other things they bound themſelves by Oath, To hurt no man, though they were commanded.</hi> In imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom the Pythagoreans did wholly abſtain from War, as <hi>being the Ringleader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, commanding murder as by a Law.</hi> Neither will it much avail to ſay for the other opinion, <hi>That it is dangerous to diſobey:</hi> For whilſt both are uncertain, (for if the War be unjuſt, it is no act of diſobedience to avoid it) he is not to be blamed that chuſeth the ſafeſt. But our diſobedience in ſuch things hath in its own nature leſs of evil than murther, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſo many Innocents. It is ſtoried by the Ancients, That when <hi>Mercury</hi> (being accuſed for killing of <hi>Argus</hi>) excuſed himſelf, for that he did it at the command of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> the reſt of the Gods, notwithſtanding, durſt not acquit him: No more doth <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pothinus,</hi> an Officer of <hi>Mark Antony</hi>'s, when he ſaith,

                     </q> Nor will that be of much greater moment which ſome men urge to the contrary, namely, That in caſe we admit that every private perſon may have liberty to judge of the juſtneſs of the War, and accordingly either yield or deny their obedience, the Commonwealth would ſoon be deſtroyed; becauſe for the moſt part it cannot be expedient for the State, that the reaſons of their counſels ſhould be communicated to the Vulgar. For although this may be true where the cauſes of the War are ſuaſory only, yet not where the War is juſtifiable; for there the cauſes thereof ſhould be publiſhed unto all, that every man may judge of them, and be ſatisfied in them. What <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſometimes ſaid, perhaps too confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly,<note place="margin">☞</note> of Laws in general, may very appoſitely be ſaid of theſe of War; <hi>No Subject ſo faithfully obſerves a Law, as he that knows the reaſon of that Law. For every Law ought to give teſtimony of its own integrity, to thoſe from whom it requires obedience. On the contrary,</hi> Suſpecta Lex eſt, quae probari ſe non vult; improba ſi non probata, dominetur: <hi>That Law that will not endure the tryal, is held ſuſpected; as that which being diſapproved, yet exacts obedience, is held as wicked.</hi> Thus when <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> endeavoured to perſwade <hi>Achilles</hi> to join with the Grecian Princes in a war againſt the Trojans, <hi>Achilles</hi> urgeth them to declare the cauſe:

                           <note place="margin">Papin.</note>What cauſe <hi>Greece</hi> hath ſo great a War to wage,</l>

                     </q> And hence it is that <hi>Theſeus</hi> in the ſame Poet thus encourageth his Souldiers,
<q>Go, and fight boldly in a Cauſe ſo juſt.</q> For as <hi>Propertius</hi> well obſerv'd, <hi>The juſtice of the Cauſe cannot but heighten the ſpirits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the indignation of a Souldier, whoſe courage droops ſo, that he grows aſhamed of his Arms when his Cauſe is nought. Herod</hi> in his Oration to the Jews, after the ſlaughter in <hi>Arabia,</hi> thus beſpeaks them,<note place="margin">Joſephus.</note> 
                     <hi>I am willing to ſhew you how juſtly I have undertaken this War, being provoked thereunto by the reproaches of our enemies; which being known unto you, muſt needs heighten your courage to a revenge.</hi> It is very often verified what the Panegyriſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>So prevalent, even amongst Armies, is a good Conſcience, that the Victory ſeems properly to belong, not to the numbers or valour of the men, but to the juſtneſs and equity of the Cauſe.</hi> And ſo ſome Learned Men have interpreted that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14. as if <hi>Abraham</hi> had before the Fight inſtructed his Servants fully in the juſtice of his Quarrel. And certainly the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of War ought to be publick, and the cauſe expreſs'd, that the whole Race of Mankind may judge of the equity of it. Prudence indeed, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> notes, is a Vertue proper to Princes; but Juſtice belongs to men as they are men. And therefore the reaſons of their counſels as Princes are not to be communicated, but the reaſons of their actions as men may be proclaimed. Theſe things conſidered, we conclude with Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> That where the Subject doth not only doubt the lawfulneſs of the War, but by very probable Arguments is induced to believe that it is unjuſt, eſpecially if that War be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, and not defenſive; <hi>he is bound to abſtain.</hi> Nay, very probable it is, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, whoſe Office it is to execute the penalty of the Law upon a condemned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, ſhould be throughly informed in the merits of his Cauſe, either by being preſent
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49430:161"/> at the whole Tryal, or by hearing the confeſſion of the perſon condemned; that ſo he may be convinced that he whom he puts to death, hath by the Law deſerved it, which in ſome places is obſerved. Neither can there any more probable reaſon be aſſigned for that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Law, whereby it was provided, That when a Malefactor was to be ſtoned,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.7. 1 Sam. 22.17.</note> the Witneſſes ſhould go before the people, and caſt the firſt ſtone at him. And for this Cauſe it was that the Kings Guards refuſed to fall upon the Prieſts of <hi>Nob</hi> at <hi>Saul</hi>'s command, being throughly convinced both of the ſanctity of their Order, and of the equity of their Cauſe. And for this very reaſon it was, that the third Captain,<note place="margin">2 Kings 1.17.</note> being ſent by <hi>Ahaziah</hi> unto <hi>Elijah,</hi> would not lay violent hands upon him. And for the ſame reaſon it was that many publick Executioners amongſt the Jews, being converted to Chriſtianity, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Offices, as being very dangerous; if we may give credit to the Martyrology,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But in caſe the Subjects minds are not ſatisfied concerning the equity of the Cauſe by their Princes Declaration, then 'tis the Office of a good Magiſtrate rather to impoſe ſome extraordinary Taxes upon them, than to compel them to ſerve him in his Wars unſatisfied; eſpecially when he may be ſupplied with men otherwiſe. Now whether theſe Souldiers do ſerve him with a good or evil intention, is no matter; for a good Prince may make uſe of both, as God himſelf doth of Satan and his Diſciples, as Inſtruments to bring about his own moſt Sovereign purpoſe: or as a poor man may and doth make uſe of Jews and Extortioners to ſupply his preſent wants, and that without ſin. Nay, though there be no doubt of the lawfulneſs of the War, yet it is not fit that Chriſtians ſhould be compelled to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills; ſeeing that to abſtain from War, even then when it is in it ſelf lawful, hath always been required of Church-men and Penitentials to preſerve them in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſanctity, and is, in all others, many ways commendable. When <hi>Celſus</hi> upbraided the Chriſtians for refuſing to go to war, <hi>Origen</hi> apologized for them thus, <hi>To thoſe who being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers would inforce us to fight for the Commonwealth, and to deſtroy men, we ſhall give this Anſwer, That even their own Idol-Prieſts, and thoſe that attend upon the ſervice of their reputed Gods, do keep themſelves unstained with humane blood, that ſo they may offer up their Sacrifices for the whole Nation with clean and unpolluted hands: Neither in caſe there ſhould ariſe a War, are theſe men to be liſted in their Armies. And if this be not done without reaſon, how much more may they be ſaid after their manner to fight, who being Priests to the Moſt High God, endeavour to preſerve themſelves free from bloud and rapine; that ſo, whilſt others are polluted with ſpoil and ſlaughter, they may wreſtle with God himſelf by conſtant and inceſſant prayers for the welfare of them that make war juſtly, and for the ſafety of them that govern righteouſly.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt then, as we have often ſaid before, in Morals, thoſe things that conduce to the End, do receive their true intrinſick value from the End; wherefore whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the End, that is to receive or recover his own Right, (taking the word <hi>Neceſſary</hi> not phyſically but morally,) that we are underſtood to have a Right unto. A Right, I ſay, ſtrictly ſo called, as namely, it ſignifies a Power or Faculty of doing in the ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Society: wherefore if I cannot otherwiſe preſerve my life, it is lawfull for me by what force ſoever to repell him that would take it away, though haply, he that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts it be without fault. Becauſe this Right of defending mine own life doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ariſe from another mans ſin, but from the Right that Nature hath granted unto me to defend my ſelf: whereby alſo I am empowered to take away from another that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by my life will otherwiſe be certainly endangered, without any reſpect at all had to his ſin; and to poſſeſs my ſelf of it, not as its right owner, for this is not indulged unto me for that end,<note place="margin">See ſecond Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. §. 10.</note> but to keep it ſo long as is neceſſary for mine own ſecurity. So by the Law of Nature, I have a Right to take away from another that which he hath formerly taken from me; or if that cannot eaſily be done, yet to take that which is equivalent unto it; as alſo for the recovery of my juſt debt: and from hence will alſo enſue Propriety or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe that breach that is made in Equality, cannot otherwiſe be repaired. So where a puniſhment is juſtly due, there all manner of Force and Violence is Lawful and Juſt, if that puniſhment cannot be had without it: And ſo whatſoever is a part of that puniſhment, as the deſtruction of Corn, Cattel, the firing of Houſes, Towns, Cities, and the like, are alſo juſt, ſo long as they exceed not in meaſure, but keep proportion with the offence.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, we muſt know, that what is our Right is not to be adjudged by the firſt cauſe of the War only, but from other emergent cauſes which ariſe in the proſecution of it; ſo we have ſeen in our Courts of Juſtice, after a Cauſe hath been well argued, a new Right hath often aroſe to a Party which was not before thought on. Thus they that ſhall aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with him that invades me, be they either Aſſociates, or Subjects, do give me a Right to defend my ſelf againſt them. So alſo they that ſhall joyn themſelves with others in a War that is unjuſt, eſpecially if they may or ought to know it to be ſo, do oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to repair the damage, and to pay the charges of the War, becauſe they have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it by their own default.

                  <head>IV. Some things may be gained without injury, indirectly, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely was not lawfull.</head>
                  <p>We muſt obſerve alſo in the third place, that whilſt we execute the Right that Nature give us, either to defend our ſelves, or to recover our own, many things do indirectly and beyond our purpoſe accrew unto us, whereunto we could otherwiſe have no Right at all. How this Rule holds in caſes of our own neceſſary defence we have elſewhere ſhewn. So in the recovery of what is our own, if we cannot get juſt as much as was ours, we may take more, but on condition that we reſtore the ſurpluſage to the Right Owner. So a Ship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are many Pyrats, or an Houſe wherein are many Thieves, may be battered down or ſunk, though it be to the endangering of many Infants, Women, and ſuch like innocent perſons that were accidentally mixt amongſt them. But this muſt ever be obſerved, that <hi>Non ſemper omni ex parte licitum est, quod juri, ſtrictè ſumpto, congruit; We are not always to extend our Right to its extremity, for not every thing that is ſtrictly due, is always and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull.</hi> For ſometimes our compaſſion towards the Innocent, and our Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbours, will not ſuffer us to exerciſe our full Right: wherefore in ſuch caſes we ought to be circumſpect, and (as much as in us lies) to foreſee, and to avoid all ſuch contingencies, which may fall out beyond that, which we principally aim at, unleſs the Good that we aim at be far greater than the Evil that we fear; or unleſs where the Good and Evil being equal, our hopes of obtaining the Good be greater, than our fears of the Evil can be, whereof prudence is the beſt Judge; yet ſo, that whenſoever the caſe ſhall happen to be doubtfull, we always incline to that part which provideth rather for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſafety than our own, as being much the ſafer, and if an errour, yet it falls on the right hand.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.29.</note>

                  <head>V. What we may do againſt them that ſupply our Enemies with what they want.</head>
                  <p>And here another Queſtion is uſually ſtarted, namely, what we may lawfully do to thoſe who are not Enemies, or at leaſt will not be ſo reputed, and yet do daily ſupply our Enemies with ſuch things as they need: Great conteſts have antiently been, and now are about this matter; ſome ſtifly maintaining the rigour of the War, others as earneſtly contending for the liberty of Trade and Traffick. But firſt we muſt diſtinguiſh of the things wherewith the Enemy is ſupplyed; for ſome things there are that are of no uſe but in War, as Arms and Ammunition; ſome things there are which are of no uſe at all in War,<note place="margin">Procop. Goth l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> as things ſerving for pleaſure only: And laſtly, ſome things there are that are uſeful both in Peace and War; as money, Victuals, Apparel, Ships, and materials for Shipping. (At <hi>Athens</hi> it was prohibited to export Flax, Bottles, Timber, Wax, Pitch, and the like) Concerning things not uſeful but in War, it is true what <hi>Amalaſuintha</hi> told the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian, He is to be eſteemed as an Enemy, that ſupplies the Enemy with things neceſſary for War:</hi> as to the ſecond ſort of things there is no juſt cauſe of complaint. So <hi>Seneca</hi> thought, <hi>The favour of a Tyrant I may purchaſe, in caſe that which I give him, do neither increaſe his power to do miſchief, nor confirm that which he already hath; for ſuch things as theſe a man may give without encreaſing the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I will not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſupply him with money whereby he may keep his Army in pay; but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Marble, Perfumes, or coſtly Apparel, theſe being but the fuel of his luſt, can hurt no man but himſelf: Soldiers and Arms will I not furniſh; but if he will accept of the beſt Artiſts I have, to make Scenes for Masks and Plays, I ſhall willingly part with them.</hi> (Thus did <hi>Hyram</hi> glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſh King <hi>Solomon</hi> with Timber, and all kind of curious Artificers, that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the delight he took in ſumptuous buildings, thereby to divert him from purſuing with his vaſt Riches his Fathers conqueſts in <hi>Syria.</hi>) So alſo St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

                     </note> to contribute to him that conſpires againſt his own Country, is no commendable liberality. As to the third ſort of things which are of doubtful uſe, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the preſent ſtate of the War. For if I cannot defend my ſelf, unleſs I do intercept thoſe things which are ſent to mine Enemy, neceſſity will give me a good Right to them; yet upon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I make reſtitution, unleſs there be ſufficient cauſe to the contrary. Again, if the ſupply that is ſent in, do hinder the execution of my defence of the deſign, and he that ſends it might have known that it would ſo do: As for example, If I have beſieged a Town, and blocked up its Ports, ſo that I may juſtly expect the ſurrender of it, or a Peace; in this Caſe, he that ſhall knowingly ſend in relief, is bound to give me ſatisfaction for the loſs I ſuſtain thereby, no leſs than he that takes a Priſoner out of Cuſtody that owes me a juſt Debt, or inſtructs him how to make his eſcape thereby to defraud me: and proportionably to that loſs I ſuſtain I may ſeize his goods, and poſeſs them as mine own till I am ſatsfied; and if the damage be not already given, but intended only, then have I a Right by the detention of thoſe ſupplies, to compel him that ſent them to give ſecurity, either by pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, hoſtages, or the like, that he will not for the future ſend any more ſupplies to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. But in Caſe the wrongs done me by mine Enemy, be manifeſtly unjuſt, and that he by thoſe ſupplies, do abet and encourage him in his unjuſt War; then he ſhall not only be bound to repair my loſs civilly, but alſo criminally, as he that reſcues a notorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, in the very preſence of a Judge: and for this Cauſe it is lawful for me to do unto him agreeable to his offence, according to thoſe rules which we have already ſet down for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. And ſo long as we contain our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lves within theſe bounds, we may make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and for this Cauſe do they that make War uſually, ſend out Declarations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to other Nations, as well to inſinuate unto them the equity of their Cauſe, as alſo what probable hopes they have to recover their Right. Now the reaſon why we refer this matter to the Law of Nature is, becauſe we find nothing certainly determined in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories by the voluntary Law of Nations, as to it. There is a Book written in Italian, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Liber conſulatus Maris,</hi> concerning the Government of the Seas, wherein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Conſtitutions of the Emperours of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the Kings of <hi>France, Spain, Syria, Cyprus,</hi> the <hi>Baleares, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Genoeſe;</hi> wherein are handled two hundred ſeventy four Queſtions upon this Subject, where we ſhall find it adjudged, That if the Ship with its freight be both the Enemies, then there is no doubt but both are lawful prize: If the Ship belong to ſuch as are at peace with us, and the goods to our Enemies, we may enforce them to put into any of our Allies or our Ports, there to unlade the goods; yet ſo, that we pay the Maſter of the Ship for the freight of them. But in Caſe the goods belong to our Friends, and the Ship to our Enemies, then is the Ship lawful prize, and to be agreed for; which if refuſed, they may be compelled into any Harbour of our Friends, and withal to pay us for the freight of thoſe goods. In the Year 1438. There being War between the Hollanders and the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> with other Cities Confederate, ſituate
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:49430:164"/> upon the Baltick Sea, and the River <hi>Albis,</hi> it was in <hi>Holland</hi> adjudged in full Senate, That the Goods found in an Enemies Ship, if it did appear that they belonged to others, were no lawfull prize, and this was there from thence eſtabliſhed for a Law; and ſo pleaded by the Daniſh King in the year 1597. who thereupon ſent his Embaſſadors into <hi>Holland</hi> to aſſert his Freedom to tranſport his Goods into <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithſtanding the bloody War which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> then had with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The like hath always been permitted by the <hi>French</hi> to any Nation that were at Peace with them, and that ſo freely, that oftentimes the Enemies have in other mens names tranſported their Goods without damage; as appears by an Edict made 1543. Chapter the 42. and by another made 1584, wherein it is provided, that their Friends might freely traffick whither they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo as it were with their own Ships, Men and Goods, and that thoſe Goods were not <hi>Belli Inſtrumenta,</hi> Arms, nor Ammunition for War, whereby their Enemies might be made ſtronger. But in caſe they did ſo, then it might be lawfull to ſeize them to their own uſe, paying a valuable price for them. Wherein two things are obſervable, firſt, That by theſe Laws, Ammunition for War was not held as lawfull prize, much leſs were other innocent Merchandizes obnoxious to this danger. I cannot deny but that theſe Northern Nations have ſometimes uſurped anothers Right, but not conſtantly, being urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto rather by preſent neceſſity, then by a perpetual equity. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon pretence of their War would not permit the <hi>Danes</hi> Freedom of Traffick, whence aroſe that War between thoſe two Nations, whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were compelled to pay a Tribute to the <hi>Danes,</hi> which was called the <hi>Dane</hi> penny, which though the Cauſe were changed, yet the name of it continued till the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, as <hi>Thuanus</hi> records it in the year 1589. Again, we find it recorded as well by <hi>Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>William Winter</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Beale</hi> to Remonſtrate, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not endure that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the heat of their War then with <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould detain their Ships trading in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports. And when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being both at War with <hi>Spain,</hi> did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> in their traffick with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with what a diſputable Right they did it, appears by the eager diſſertations of both Nations, which are worthy our peruſal for the deciding of this Controverſie. And it is obſervable, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves do in their writings acknowledge no leſs, whereas they principally inſiſt upon theſe two Arguments to defend their Cauſe; namely, That the <hi>Germans</hi> did furniſh the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Inſtruments of War: and ſecondly, that it had been mutually agreed in Ancient Treaties between both Nations, That it ſhould not be lawfull for them ſo to do. The like agreement we find afterwards made between the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their Aſſociates, and the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> and theirs, in the year 1593. That neither the one nor the other ſhould permit the Subjects of their Enemies to traffick within their Dominions, or ſhould aid them with either Men, Money, Ships or Victuals. And afterwards, namely, in the year 1617. It was agreed between the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> That the <hi>Dane</hi> ſhould obſtruct all manner of Traffick with the City of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> being then at Enmity with the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and not only ſo, but that they ſhould not ſuffer any Merchandizes to paſs through the <hi>Sound,</hi> or the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea to any of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Enemies; for which the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> was to receive other Priviledges and advantages from the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> But theſe are particular Contracts, from whence no general Rule can be inferred. Neither did the Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> only blame the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for denying them freedom of Traffick with their Enemies: But the <hi>Polanders</hi> alſo complained againſt them in the year 1597, as <hi>Cambden</hi> relates, That the Law of Nations wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So in the League that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their Aſſociates, it was agreed, That other Nations whom it concern'd to give check to the ſwelling Power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, ſhould be ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to forbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, when in the ſame year ſeveral <hi>Hamburgers</hi> were taken laden moſtly with Inſtruments of War, thoſe only were challenged by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as prize; but for the reſt of the Commodities they paid the juſt value. But the <hi>French</hi> when their Ships were ſeized and confiſcate by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe bound for <hi>Spain,</hi> did declare unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that they would not ſuffer it. It is fit therefore, as I have ſaid, That there ſhould be Remonſtrances and publick Declarations, forbidding Traffick with our Enemies, before we ſeize their Goods as Prize. So Queen

                  <head>VIII. Fraud in its poſitive acts diſtinguiſhed.</head>
                  <p>But fraud which conſiſts in a poſitive act, if in things, is called ſimulation; if in words, a lye. Some place the difference between theſe two in this, That words do naturally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the conceptions of our minds, but things not ſo: But on the contrary, words, of their own nature, and ſet aſide from that ſenſe which men have agreed to give them, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, unleſs it be ſuch an inarticulate and confuſed noiſe as pain and grief cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to make, which is more underſtood by the thing we ſuffer, than by the noiſe we utter. And if it be objected, that it is peculiar to the Nature of Man, above all other Creatures, That he is able to expreſs the manifold conceptions of his mind unto others, to which end words and voices were invented, we do not deny it: Yet this alſo may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That ſuch indications are not made by words only, but by becks, nods, and other ſigns made by the eyes, head or hand, as among ſuch as are born dumb. (Thus <hi>Pliny</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies of the Aethiopians,<note place="margin">Pliny lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Quibuſdam pro ſermone, nutus, motuſque membrorum eſt; That ſome of them inſtead of words, expreſs their minds by various motions of their other members.</hi>) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe becks, or other motions have naturally ſomething common with the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, or whether they have a certain ſignification by agreement only. Conſonant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are thoſe Aegyptian Hieroglyphicks, which as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer ſaith, ſignifie not words but things: for ſaith he, <hi>It is not the figures of the letters, but the ſpeech exprest by thoſe letters that do oblige us ſo far forth as it is agreed on, That what is by any writing declared, ſhall be as binding, as what is exprest by word of mouth.</hi> Where you muſt note, that the word <hi>Placuit</hi> is very emphatical, as ſhewing that that which gives ſuch force and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to words is conſent and agreement. And here again we muſt have recourſe unto that diſtinction, which we made uſe of to take away all ambiguity concerning this word, <hi>the Law of Nations.</hi> For we then ſaid, that the Law of Nations ſignified, either that which was admitted of by every Nation without mutual obligation, or that which all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did mutually oblige themſelves to obſerve. Now voices, nods, and ſuch like indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the mind, are admitted to ſignifie things by mutual obligation, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to agreement; whereof ſome are ſo univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on to ſignifie ſuch and ſuch things, that all Nations are obliged ſo to underſtand them; which cannot be ſo generally underſtood of things. Whence it follows, that it is lawfull for me to do or uſe other acts, or things, though I do foreſee that another man will conceive a falſe opinion of them: I ſpeak of that which is intrinſick, and not of that which is accidental. And therefore we muſt give an inſtance, firſt of ſuch a caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no detriment at all enſues; ſuch was that of <hi>Michal</hi> when ſhe deceived her Father, with an Image laid in ſtead of <hi>David.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.16. Luke 24.28.</note> Thus our bleſſed Saviour ſeemed to his two Diſciples, as if he would have travelled beyond <hi>Emaus;</hi> and perhaps he intended ſo to do, unleſs they

Another example may be given in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> who doubtleſs when he circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 16.3.</note> knew very well what conſtruction the Jews would make of it, namely, That the Law of the Circumciſion, though aboliſhed by Chriſt, did ſtill, even in the judgment of the Apoſtles, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whereas S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> diſpenſing with this errour, propoſeth to himſelf another end, namely, That through that miſtake he and <hi>Timothy</hi> might gain the advantage of a more free and friendly converſation with them. For the Ceremonial Law being aboliſhed, neither did circumciſion, by its firſt inſtitution, any longer ſignifie a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping that Law; neither was the evil of that errour, which from thence aroſe, and for a while continued, (though afterwards to be exploded) ſo great as was that good which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> then aimed at, which was a more facile inſinuation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. The Greek Fathers do uſually expreſs this kind of ſimulation by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſignifying a diſpenſation. So <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>

                     <hi>This was no deceit nor hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, but a compliance or diſpenſation.</hi> And again, upon that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul, To the Jews I became a Jew,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to the end he might convert thoſe that were really ſuperstitious, at first appeared unto them to be ſo too, making an outward ſhew, as though he had been otherwiſe than what he was; he did ſuch things as they did, but not with the ſame purpoſe and intention as they did.</hi> And this is his meaning when he ſaith, <hi>I became all things to all men, that I might ſave ſome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.12.</note> Hither alſo we may refer that perſonated madneſs of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the Court of <hi>Achiſh.</hi> There is is a notable Saying extant of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who, deſcribing the qualities of a good man, ſaith, <hi>That ſome things he will do for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſake, which otherwiſe he would not do.</hi> Such was that act of the Romans, who when their City was beſieged, threw great quantities of Bread from the Capitol into their Enemies Camp, (when in truth they had but little to ſpare) to the end that their enemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to take the City by Famine, might give over the Siege. Another example of ſuch a ſimulation wherein the hurt or detriment that follows (ſetting aſide the fraud) is lawful, we have in that feigned flight of <hi>Joſhua</hi> before the Inhabitants of <hi>Aye,</hi> Joſh. 8.<note place="margin">Joſh. 8.</note> which is very frequently practiſed by other Generals. For ſuch a ſeeming flight is, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs, lawful, as ſignifying nothing by conſent or agreement, but according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that the enemy will make of it, wherein, if they are deceived, they deceive themſelves. And to this end alſo it is lawful for us to make uſe of our Enemies Armes, Colours, Garments, Sails, and the like, whereof we ſhall read in all Hiſtories. For all theſe things every man hath liberty to make uſe of, though contrary to uſual cuſtom, at his own pleaſure; becauſe that very cuſtome of uſing or wearing ſuch or ſuch a colour or faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in every mans particular choice, and is not appropriated to this or that Nation by common conſent, and therefore obligeth none.</p>

                  <p>It is required therefore to the nature of a lye, commonly ſo taken, that what is either ſpoken or written, or by any other ſigns expreſt, cannot otherwiſe be underſtood than in ſuch a ſenſe as is different from his mind that ſo declares it. But to a lye ſtrictly taken, as it is naturally unlawful, there is neceſſarily required ſome peculiar difference, which if rightly underſtood, at leaſt according to the common acception of Nations, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the violation of his exiſting and remaining right with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. For certain it is that in reſpect of himſelf no man can lye, let him ſpeak never ſo much falſhood. Where by Right, I underſtand not every Right, and what is extrinſick to the thing; but that which merely relates unto the matter in hand, which is nothing elſe but his freedom with whom we diſcourſe, to judge at the conceptions of our minds, which as by a ſilent Contract, we are preſumed to owe unto him. For this, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is that mutual obligation which men were willing to introduce ſo ſoon as language was invented, or thoſe other notes or ſigns generally received as ſignificant of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts; without which obligation that invention had been altogether fruitleſs. (And therefore amongſt the Hebrews, he that deprived a man of the means of knowledg, was ſaid <hi>cor furari,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cor furari.</note>

For poſſible it is that though there was ſuch a freedome, yet it is then taken away, or may be by ſome other right that is ſupervenient. As a Debt that was, may ceaſe to be ſo, by reaſon either of an Acquittance given, or a failing of the performance of ſome Condition. Again, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, That the right that is violated be his with whom we diſcourſe, and not a By-ſtanders, or any other mans. As in a Contract there ariſeth no injuſtice, but by the violation of the right of one of the Contractors. Hence haply it is that after <hi>Simonides, Plato</hi> refers the ſpeaking of truth to juſtice. And that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>As to the manner, how the War ſhould be proſecuted, this rule is pertinent, What is unlawful for a man to do, is alſo unlawful for another to compel or perſwade him to do, whereof let theſe ſuffice for examples.

                  <p>LET us now deſcend to thoſe Rights, which the Law of Nations grants unto us; ſome whereof appertain to every War, others to ſome particular kinds of Wars only. Let us now begin with generals. By the bare Law of nature no man is bound by the fact of another, but he that ſucceeds to inherit his Goods; for as ſoon as Dominion was firſt introduced, it was likewiſe agreed on, That all debts ſhould paſs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Goods to the next Occupant,<note place="margin">

Hence ariſe thoſe titles in the Roman Laws, That the Wife ſhall not be ſued for the Husband, nor the Husband for the Wife; the Son for the Father, nor the Father or Mother for the Son. Neither as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> ſaith expreſly, ſhall any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon be liable to the debts of the Commonwealth; that is, if the common ſtock be able to diſcharge them; otherwiſe they ſhall, not as individual perſons, but as they are a part of the whole.<note place="margin">De Benef. l <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi>

                     <hi>If any man ſhall lend his money to my Country,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, I ſhall not acknowledge my ſelf his debtor, yet ſhall I willingly advance my proportion, not as my own debt, but to diſengage my Country.</hi> And again, <hi>Singuli debebunt non tanquam proprium, ſed tanquam publici partem; What the Commonwealth owes, every particular Citizen owes, not as his own debt, but as his part of the publick.</hi> It was particularly provided by the Roman Laws, That no one of the Villagers ſhould be obliged for another of the Villagers debts: and in another place, That no ones poſſeſſions ſhould be deſtrained for the debts of another; no, not for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And in <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Novels, Repriſals are expreſly forbidden, and this reaſon added, <hi>Becauſe it hath no face or colour of justice, that one man ſhould be the debtor, another enforced to pay the debt, where alſo ſuch exactions are called odious.</hi> Thus did <hi>Theodorick</hi> in <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> account it, for one man to be kept as a Pledge or Hoſtage for another.</p>

                  <head>II. But by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Subjects are for their Prince.</head>
                  <p>Although theſe things be true, yet by the voluntary Law of Nations it may be, nay as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, it hath been, introduced, That what debts ſoever any Civil Society, or their Prince ſhall contract, either primarily by themſelves, or be engaged for by not rendring unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that which is their right; all the Goods both corporeal and incorporeal of thoſe that are ſubject to that Society or the Prince thereof, ſhall be liable and ſtand bound to diſcharge. Now this ſeems to be inforced by a kind of neceſſity; for otherwiſe the Gap would be ſo wide as to let in all manner of injuries. For the goods of Princes are but few, and thoſe not ſo eaſily taken as thoſe of private mens which are many: wherefore it is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49430:169"/> by <hi>Justinian</hi> amongſt thoſe Laws which cuſtome had found requiſite to be conſtituted, for the relief of humane neceſſity. Neither will this be found ſo repugnant to nature, that it might not be introduced by cuſtom and by the tacite conſent of Nations, ſeeing that Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do ſtand firmly bound for other mens debts, without any other cauſe than by their voluntary ſuſception only. And very probable it is that the Members of any one Society may more eaſily be relieved one by another, than Strangers can, whoſe complaints, though never ſo juſt, are little regarded in many places. Beſides, the benefit that ariſeth from this obligation, being common to all Nations, they that find themſelves aggrieved by it at one time, may be relieved by it ſome other. Nor is this cuſtom in force only where there is a perfect and compleat War between Nation and Nation. (For what is lawful in ſuch Wars appears by the very words of their denunciation, <hi>Against the ancient Latine People,</hi>

                  <head>III. An example in taking of men Priſoners:</head>
                  <p>A branch of the execution of this right was that which the Athenians called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the making men Priſoners;</hi> concerning which the Attick Law was this, <hi>If any man had been by forcible aſſault killed by a Stranger, the next of kin had a right to take any three men Priſoners, but no more, and to detain them until the Murderer were either puniſhed, or delivered up to be puniſhed.</hi> Hence we may perceive, That there is a kind of incorporeal right of Subjects (that is, a liberty to live where, and to do what they pleaſe) engaged for the debts of every Society, which ought to puniſh ſuch of their own Society as ſhall dare to injure thoſe of another Society; ſo that any of the Members of that Society that ſhall neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or refuſe to do it, if taken, may be held in bondage until that Society do what they ought; that is, until they either puniſh or deliver up the Offender. For although the Egyptians (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> teſtifies) did maintain, That it was not juſt to impriſon a man for debt; yet is there nothing in it repugnant to nature. And the general practice not only of the Grecians, but of moſt other Nations, is ſufficient to warrant the contrary. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocrates,</hi> who was Contemporary with <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> demanded, That a Decree might paſs, That whoſoever ſhould kill <hi>Charidemus,</hi> ſhould be taken away from what place ſoever; and that whoſoever ſhould make reſiſtance, ſhould be held as an enemy. In which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> obſerves theſe errours: Firſt, that <hi>Ariſtocrates</hi> did not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the putting to death of <hi>Charidemus</hi> juſtly or unjuſtly, ſeeing that poſſible it was that he might deſerve death; next that he did not require that judgment ſhould firſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded againſt him: And thirdly, that not they amongſt whom he ſhould be killed, but they that ſhould receive the murtherer being eſcaped into protection ſhould be proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as enemies. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his words are to this purpoſe, <hi>If a murther be committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst any people, and they refuſe either to puniſh or to deliver up the murtherer, the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the apprehenſion of three men; but</hi> Ariſtocrates <hi>leaves theſe men untoucht, and not ſo much as mentions them; but would have thoſe perſecuted as enemies who have according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right of Nations concerning ſuppliants received him that hath eſcaped by flight, for ſo I put the caſe, into protection, unleſs they deliver him.</hi> The fourth thing that he reproves, is, that <hi>Ariſtocrates</hi> would inſtantly bring it to an abſolute War; whereas the Law requires only the detention of three men. Of theſe four exceptions, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> takes againſt <hi>Ariſtocrates</hi> his Decree, the firſt, the ſecond, and the fourth are not altogether without reaſon; but for the third, unleſs reſtrained to the ſole event of the murther done, either accidentally, or in the defence of himſelf, I cannot perceive why it ſhould be mentioned, unleſs it were like an Orator for arguments ſake, rather than truly or juſtly: for as we
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:49430:170"/> ſaid before,<note place="margin">Vid. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi> Sect. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> That Right which all men challenge of receiving and defending Suppliants, doth concern thoſe only whom Fortune, and not their own crimes have made miſerable; for otherwiſe there is the ſame Law for thoſe amongſt whom the crime is committed, as for thoſe who reſuſe either to puniſh or deliver the guilty. And ſurely either the Law it ſelf cited by <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> hath through cuſtom been thus interpreted, or againſt ſuch cavils was afterwards more liquidly expreſt; the truth of one of theſe, none will deny, that reads that of <hi>Julius Pollux,</hi>

                  <p>And this may be preſumed, not only when they cannot in any reaſonable time obtain judgment againſt a delinquent or a debtor: But when in a Caſe that will hardly admit of any doubt, ſentence ſhall paſs plainly againſt Right; for Caſes that are ambiguous, the definitive power is ſuppoſed to be in the Delegates, as perſons publickly choſen to do Juſtice,<note place="margin">Vid.

                     </note> whoſe Authority notwithſtanding is not of the ſame force to oblige ſtrangers, as their own Subjects; nay, even between their own Subjects, it makes not a debt void that was juſtly due: For as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer obſerves, <hi>Verus debitor, licet abſolutus ſit, Natura tamen debitor permanet; He that owes a real debt, though he be diſcharged by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judge, yet by the Law of Nature ſtands ſtill obliged. And when by the injury of the Judge, a Creditor had taken away from the right Owner ſomething that had not been the Debtors, as if engaged unto him: the queſtion being put, Whether the debt being paid, that thing were to be reſtored to the debtor;</hi> Scaevola <hi>proved that it ought to be reſtored.</hi> But between a Subject and a Stranger, there is this difference, Subjects are bound up by the Sentence of the Judge, though it be unjuſt, ſo as they can neither reſiſt the execution of it lawfully; nor by Force recover their own Right againſt a Sentence unjuſtly given, by reaſon of the efficacy of that power they live under: But Strangers have a coercive power, though it be not lawfull for them to uſe it ſo long as they may recover their Right in a Judicial way: wherefore in ſuch a Caſe, that both the Perſons, and the moveable Goods of his Subjects that refuſe to reſtore what is violently taken away, may be by the like violence taken, is not introduced by Nature, but by Cuſtom generally received in all Nations. The moſt ancient Example of this we may read of in <hi>Homers Iliads,</hi> where <hi>Neſtor</hi> is ſaid to drive away the Cattle of the <hi>Elidenſes;</hi> becauſe they had before plundered his Fathers Horſes: whereupon as the ſtory goes on, Proclamation was made, That every man to whom the <hi>Elidenſes</hi> did owe any thing, ſhould come and partake of the ſpoil, in ſuch a manner, as that every man might have his juſt proportion. Another Example we have of this in the Roman Hiſtory, where <hi>Ariſtodemus Tarquin</hi>'s heir, ſeizeth the Roman Ships lying in Harbor at <hi>Cumae,</hi> which he detained for the Goods of the <hi>Tarquines</hi> detained in <hi>Rome.</hi> And in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> we find a Decree againſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to ſeize all foreign ſhips, if any man had a Right ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>Moreover as well in this, as in ſeveral other Caſes, we muſt take heed, That we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between thoſe things that are properly due by the Law of Nations, and thoſe
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49430:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> that are due by the Civil Law, or by a mutual agreement between ſome people. By the Law of Nations, all Subjects that are injurious unto the Subjects of another Prince are liable to this Law of Reprizals, eſpecially if they have occaſion to reſide there, whether they be Natives or Strangers; but not if they be only Travellers, or ſojourn there but for a little time. For theſe Pignorations are of the ſame nature with Taxes, which being raiſed for the diſcharge of publick debts, are impoſed on ſuch as are conſtant Inhabitants, and not on ſuch as are Sojourners, and ſo ſubject to the Laws of the place for a while only. Neither are the Perſons or the Goods of Embaſſadors, being not ſent to our Enemies, any wayes liable to this right of Pignorations by the Law of Nations; as alſo in many places the perſons of Women and Children are by the Civil Law often exempted: But even the Goods of ſuch as addict themſelves to Learning or to Merchandizing, may by the Law of Nations be taken by any, as their perſons alſo were at <hi>Athens.</hi> But by the Civil Law of many places, this Right of ſeizing Goods or Perſons, muſt firſt be demanded from the Supreme Power, but in other places from the Judges. By the Laws of Nations the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of things taken paſſeth immediately to him that takes them to the value of his principal debt, together with his charges, ſo as the remainder ought to be reſtored. Thus did the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> as <hi>Gregoras</hi> relates; <hi>Whoſe ſhips,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>being taken at</hi> Galata, <hi>laden with Wheat, Barly, and Salt for Fiſh, whereof the Lakes of</hi> Copais,<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. <hi>9.</hi>

But what manner of War this is, is beſt underſtood by the definition which the <hi>Romans</hi> give of an enemy, <hi>Hoſtes ſunt qui nobis, aut quibus nos publicè bellum decernimus; They are Enemies,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pomponius, against whom we publickly denounce War, or who do the like against us;</hi> the reſt are but Pyrats and Robbers: to the very ſame purpoſe ſpeaks <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian:</hi> Wherefore as he there adds, He that is taken by Robbers, is not a ſlave to thoſe that take him, neither need he recover his freedom by the Right of Poſtliminy,<note place="margin">L.

This only is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That under the Example of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſoever in any City or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth hath the Supreme Power, hath a Right to make a Juſt War; according to that of <hi>Cicero,</hi>

                  <p>Neither doth a Common-wealth ceaſe to be a Common-wealth, becauſe ſome Acts of Injuſtice are publickly and generally committed by them; nor are Robbers or Pyrats to be deemed a Civil Society, becauſe haply they do obſerve ſome kind of equality between themſelves, without which no Society can poſſibly long ſubſiſt: For theſe latter are not (as <hi>Procopius</hi> ſpeaks<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">De Civit. Dei lib. <hi>19.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>

That which <hi>Dion Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves, comes much nearer to truth, who tells us, That the Law (eſpecially that of Nations) is in a City, as the Soul in an humane Body; which being taken away, it remains no longer a City.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.</note> So likewiſe <hi>Cicero</hi> in another place, <hi>There were neither Laws nor judgments, nor any ſign to ſhew that there was a Commonwealth. Ariſtides</hi> in his perſwaſive Oration to the Rhodians for Peace, proves that many good Laws may very well conſiſt even with Tiranny. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de rep.</note> That he that ſtrains the power, either of the Nobles or of the People, to too high a key, marrs the Harmony of good Government; and firſt corrupts the Commonwealth, and then deſtroys it. Let us illuſtrate this by examples: That they who are taken by Robbers, are not made ſlaves, was (as we have ſaid) the opinion of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian.</hi> But if a Roman Citizen was taken by the Germans or Parthians, he loſt his freedom; and yet among the Germans,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6.</note> the Roberies that were done without the bounds of the City were blameleſs, which are <hi>Caeſars</hi> own words. <hi>Tacitus</hi> records it of the <hi>Garamantes,</hi> that they were, <hi>Gens Latroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis foecunda, ſed Gens tamen;</hi> A <hi>Nation wholly addicted to Roberies, but yet a Nation though.</hi> The Illirians ſpoiled all they met at Sea without regard; but yet to him that ſubdued them, was a triumph granted; which was denied to <hi>Pompey</hi> who had purged the Sea of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. So great is the difference between a Nation though corrupt, and a company of men combined only to do miſchief.</p>

                  <head>III. Yet there often happens a change.</head>
                  <p>Yet a change doth ſometimes happen, not in particular perſons only; as in <hi>Jephtha, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces, Variatus,</hi> who of Captains over Thieves and Robbers, became lawful Commanders; but in Societies alſo: As when a company of Robbers or Pirates ſhall forſake that wicked kind of life, and unanimouſly betake themſelves to a Civil Government, an example whereof we have in the Mamertines. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning Robberies ſpeaks thus, <hi>When this miſchief by the concourſe of men of deſperate fortunes, grows ſo great, that they betake themſelves to ſome certain place to inhabit, and there build Cities, raiſe Forts, and thereby are able to ſubdue Nations; then it aſſumes the title of a Kingdom or free State: Not,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> goes on,<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei, l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>that they ceaſe to be what before they were; but becauſe what they formerly did through fear, and therefore ſecretly, they now do with boldneſs and confidence. It was a bold anſwer, that</hi> Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>the Pirate made to</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, when he demanded of him the reaſon why he ſo troubled the Seas; For the ſame</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou doſt the World: But becauſe I rob with one ſingle Ship, I am called a Pirate; whereas thou, becauſe with a great Fleet, art therefore ſtiled an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi> But that which makes this change according to what is here intended, is not ſo much their impunity as their repentance. For this St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> requires, that deſerting their wicked courſes, they live together under ſome wholſom Laws, according unto which, juſtice may be adminiſtred, as well to ſtrangers, as natives.</p>

                  <p>Who they are that have ſoveraign Power we have already ſhewed, from whence we may alſo collect, That he that hath that power but for a part, may for that part make a juſt War; much more, they who are not Subjects but Confederates, though on Articles very unequal.

                  <p>This denunciation of War is ſometimes conditional, and ſometimes abſolute.

                  <p>Now the reaſon why a Solemn Denunciation is ſo neceſſarily required unto ſuch a War as by the Law of Nations is Juſt, is not (as ſome think) to prevent deceit and treachery; for this is better referred to Magnanimity than to Juſtice. Thus have we read of ſome Nations ſo confident of their own ſtrength, that they have appointed the time and place long before, when and where they would give their Enemies battle: As <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did to King <hi>Porſenna</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Alb. Gent. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note>. Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> ſent an Herald to <hi>James</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to let him know, that on the <hi>Friday</hi> following he would give him Battle, if he would ſtay ſo long in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son, then Lord Admiral ſent the King word, that he might find him in the Van of his Army; as <hi>Herbert</hi> Records it in his Hiſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">The Turks two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Battle make many great fires. <hi>Chalcoc. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Ira. cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 43. But the true reaſon is to remonſtrate unto all Nations, That the War is made not raſhly or upon any private ends, but with the Conſent and Approbation of both Nations, or at leaſt of thoſe who have the Supreme Power on both ſides. For from hence ariſeth thoſe effects proper to a Juſt War, which in a War made with Pyrats and Robbers, or in a War made by a Prince againſt his own Subjects will not be allowed. And therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> did well diſtinguiſh between <hi>a War denounced against Foreigners, and that made against Subjects or Citizens.</hi>

                  <head>IV. Why ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</head>
                  <p>Now the Reaſon of this ſo great a licence granted by all Nations, is this, becauſe when two Nations are at War, for any other Nation to judge, where the Right is, had been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; for by that means, that Nation may quickly be intangled in the others War, as the Marſeillians pleaded in the Cauſe of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> And therefore they confeſt, That they had neither Wiſdom nor Power ſufficient to determine, whether of them had the Juſter Cauſe. Beſides even where the War is manifeſtly Juſt, it is a very nice thing by any outward token to judge which is the Juſt Rule or Meaſure, either of defending our ſelves, of recovering our own Right, or of exacting puniſhments: So that it is agreed, that it is much better to leave it to the Honeſty and Conſcience of the Princes engaged to determine of theſe things among themſelves, than to refer it to the arbitrement of others. Thus did the Achaians demand of the Roman Senate, <hi>How it came to paſs, that what had formerly been acted by the Right of War, ſhould now fall into debate?</hi> Now beſides this of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and impunity, there is another effect of a Juſt and Solemn War, namely <hi>Dominion,</hi> whereof we ſhall treat hereafter.</p>

                  <head>V. Teſtimonies of theſe effects.</head>
                  <p>But the licence that a Juſt War gives to one Enemy againſt another, extends either to his perſon, or his Eſtate: And firſt to the perſon of an Enemy, and hereof we have many teſtimonies recorded in the moſt approved Authors: The Greek Proverb acquitteth the Souldier for what he doth againſt the perſon of an Enemy in the time of War, in that it ſaith,
<q>He guiltleſs is that doth his Enemy kill.<note place="margin">Euripides.</note>
                     </q> The cuſtom of the ancient Grecians was not to waſh nor to eat with an Homicide, much leſs to joyn with him in any Duties that were holy, and yet with him that in the War had killed an Enemy it was lawfull. And in all Authors we read, That to kill was <hi>Jus Belli, the Right of War. Marcellus</hi> in <hi>Livy</hi> juſtifies himſelf by this Right,<note place="margin">

Cicero</hi> likewiſe in his Oration for King <hi>Dejotarus</hi> pleads thus, <hi>And why, O</hi> Caeſar, <hi>ſhould he be ſuſpected as thine enemy, who could not forget, that whereas thou mighteſt have adjudged him even to death by the Law of Arms, thou madeſt both him and his Sons alſo Kings?</hi> And in another place he confeſſeth, <hi>That whereas</hi> Caeſar,<note place="margin">Pro M.

For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of which doubt, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the perſons ſent: for in caſe he be ſuch a one as hath any ways given his faith, either expreſly or tacitely, unto him whoſe life he attempts; as if he be a Subject that ſhall be hired to kill his Sovereign, a Vaſſal his Lord, or a Souldier his General, or if he be received by him in protection as a Suppliant, a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a Renegado; yea if the perſon ſent owe any faith to him whom he is ſent to kill; then the Law of Nations doth not only condemn the perſon that is the inſtrument for his treachery and perfidiouſneſs, but thoſe alſo that make uſe of him. For although in other matters he that makes uſe of wicked inſtruments, though againſt an enemy, may be found guilty before God; yet is he not ſo before man. For he is not thereby ſaid to violate the Law of Nations, becauſe in this Caſe, <hi>Mores Leges perduxerunt in poteſtatem ſuam; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom hath prevailed above the Laws.</hi> Et decipere, pro moribus temporum, prudentia eſt: <hi>And to deceive</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) <hi>if it accord with the manners and customs of the Age we live in,</hi>

Diodorus Siculus</hi> complains againſt <hi>Agathocles</hi> his Souldiers, <hi>That they abſtained not from that foul ſin of raviſhment.</hi> The like doth <hi>Appian</hi> in his Mithridatick War, concerning the Captives taken in <hi>Chius, That both Women and Children were barbarouſly raviſhed by thoſe that led them away priſoners. Aelian</hi> ſpeaking of the inſolencies of the Sicyonians, being Conquerours in raviſhing the Pellenaean Virgins, and Matrons crys out thus, <hi>Theſe by the Gods of Greece are ſuch acts of cruelty and inhumanity, as were never to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, allowed of by the very Barbarians.</hi> And ſurely it is but reaſonable, that this ſhould be generally obſerved among the Chriſtians, not only as a part of our Military Diſcipline, but as a part of the Law of Nations: namely, <hi>That he that ſhall forcibly abuſe a Woman, though in the War, ſhall every where be puniſhable.

                     <hi>CIcero</hi> in the third of his Offices gives this Rule, <hi>Non est contra naturam ſpoliare eum, quem honeſtum est necare; It is no whit repugnant to the Law of Nature, to ſpoil and plunder him, whom it is lawfull to kill.</hi> It is not then to be wondered at, That the Law of Nations permits the ſpoil and devaſtation of an Enemies Land and Goods, ſeeing that it permits him to be killed. <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Neither are things ſacred, that is, conſecrated to any one or more Gods, exempted from theſe Out-rages of War, meerly by the Law of Nations, ſetting aſide the conſideration of other Duties: for, <hi>Cum loca capta ſunt ab hoſtibus, omnia deſinunt eſſe ſacra; As ſoon as any place is taken from the Enemy, every thing in it ceaſeth to be ſacred,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pomponius.</hi> And ſo ſaith <hi>Cicero, Sacra Syracuſarum victoria profana fecerat, The victory made all the ſacred things in</hi> Syracuſe <hi>profane. Tertullian</hi> in his Apologeticks confeſſeth, <hi>That War and Victory cannot conſiſt without the ſubverſion of Cities; which alſo cannot happen without ſome injury done to their tutelar Gods. For Temples undergo the ſame fate that their Cities do, and their Prieſts have an equal ſhare in publick Calamities as other Citizens; neither do their conſecrated veſſels eſcape better than their profane.</hi> Tot Sacrilegia Romanorum, quot Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaea; tot de diis, quot de gentibus triumphi: <hi>Look how many Victories the Romans had, ſo many Sacriledges they committed; and as often as they conquered their Enemies, they ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rifled their Gods.</hi> The cauſe whereof is this, becauſe thoſe things which are ſaid to be ſacred, are not in truth exempted from humane uſes, but are made publick, as <hi>Marſilius Patavinus</hi> obſerves in his Defence of Peace: But they are called Sacred,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 2.</note> from the end whereunto they are deſtin'd, which appears by this, That when any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple give themſelves up to another People, or to any King, they deliver up that alſo which is called Sacred; as is manifeſt by the uſual form in <hi>Livy, We the People of</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania, <hi>do deliver up into your Power and Poſſeſſion, O Fathers Conſcript, our City</hi> Capua, <hi>our Fields, the Temples of our Gods, together with all that we have whether Humane or Divine:</hi> (the like we read in <hi>Plautus</hi> his Amphitryo.)

So when <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, the Image of <hi>Jupiter Hercaeus</hi> was given to <hi>Sthenelus,</hi> and many other Examples he there brings.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>That all the Ceremonies, Temples and Images, that were in any of the Cities of</hi> Italy, <hi>were at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and under the Juriſdiction of the Romans.</hi> Wherefore it is plain, That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves changing their minds, may make any thing profane that was holy; and this is not obſcurely proved by thoſe great Lawyers <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Venulejus.</hi> We may alſo obſerve, That in times of War, and in caſes of neceſſity, thoſe things which have been conſecrated, have by thoſe that conſecrated them been converted to uſes of War; as was done by the Syracuſians in the time of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifies.

And <hi>Agapetus</hi> pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Conſecrated Veſſels, as <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> relates. The Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> in his great neceſſity, turned all the Veſſels of the Church into Money, the price whereof he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtored, as <hi>Theophanes</hi> writes. The like was done by <hi>Pericles,</hi> but with a promiſe of reſtitution; by <hi>Mago</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Romans in their War againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> by <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Pompey, Caeſar,</hi> and many others. <hi>There is nothing ſo Sacred, ſo Holy, as thoſe things that are Conſecrated to the Worſhip of the Gods,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch: And yet there is none that can hinder the people from uſing them, or removing them as they pleaſe.

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 8.</note> as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> relates it. It is acknowledged by <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> That whatſoever was Conſecrated to the Gods,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verr.</hi> 3.</note> was lawful prize to the Conquerour. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Publius Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Images, and other Ornaments of the Enemies Cities, which by force and valour he had conquered, He by the Law of Arms, and by the Right of Conquest took and carried away.</hi> So <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Fabius,</hi> ſaith, That the Image of <hi>Hercules</hi> which he took at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> he ſent to be placed in the Capitol at <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving the reſt of their Gods as enraged againſt the Tarentines. So alſo <hi>Livy</hi> concerning the Ornaments taken out of the Temples at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaith, That they were <hi>Parta Jure Belli, Got by the Right of War.</hi> Thus <hi>Fulvius</hi> alſo in his Oration, calls the ſpoilings of Temples, <hi>the Rights of War.</hi> The like we read in <hi>Salust</hi> of <hi>Cato,</hi> who recounting the miſeries that uſually befall the Conquered, brings in this amongſt others, the robbing of their Churches. But yet in caſe it be believed, That there is any thing of a Deity in this or that Image, then to break it, to ſpoil or deface it, is in them that are of that perſwaſion, great impiety. And upon this preſumption, that both Parties agree in this belief, it is, That they that commit ſuch robberies, are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten branded with impiety, and accuſed for violating the Law of Nations. But in caſe the Enemy be of another perſwaſion, then it is otherwiſe. As to the Jews it was not only permitted but commanded,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.5.</note> That they ſhould utterly aboliſh the Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but that they ſhould not aſſume them to themſelves: the reaſon was, to inſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the greater deteſtation of their ſuperſtitions, by begetting this conceit in them, That the very touching of them was not without pollution; and not that what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to ſtrange Gods was to be ſpared,<note place="margin">Antiq. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; lib. <hi>2.</hi> Contr.

For the Hebrews moſt aſſuredly knew, that in thoſe Images there was nothing ſacred, neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor any virtue of the Stars, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles dreamed, unleſs they were ſuch Evil Spirits as are uſually deſtructive to Mankind. And therefore as <hi>Tacitus</hi> rightly obſerved, in his deſcription of the Manners and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Jews, <hi>Profana illis omnia, quae apud nos ſacra; All things that are holy to us, are unto them profane.</hi> It is no wonder then, that we read of ſo many Idol Temples burnt by the Macchabees,<note place="margin">That <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> ſhould ſack the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not to be admired; but for <hi>Joaz</hi> (though an Idolater) yet one that acknowledged the Eternal True God, and that had worſhipped him that was Lord of the Temple: That he, I ſay, ſhould lay his hands on the Conſecrated Veſſels, and call the Family of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> whoſe Children had the Hereditary charge of its Treaſures to a ſtrict account, as if they had been Officers of his own Exchequer; this was an execrable ſin, which haſtened his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 5. and 10.</p>

                     <hi>Xerxes</hi> when he demoliſh'd all the Idols of the Grecians, did nothing contrary to the Law of Nations, though all their Hiſtorians did bitterly inveigh againſt him. For the Perſians could not believe, that there was any Divinity in them, becauſe they adore the Sun only as God, and the fire as a ſpark or ray of the Deity; and therefore as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> tells us, did their <hi>Magi</hi> abhor Images.

                  <p>BEſides the licence that a juſt War gives to commit ſuch acts againſt men, whereof we have treated hitherto; there is alſo another effect, which by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is proper to a ſolemn War. And indeed, even by the Law of Nature, thoſe things may be acquired by a juſt War, which are, either equivalent to that<note n="*" place="margin">Vide lib. <hi>2.</hi> ch. <hi>7.</hi> §. <hi>2.</hi> Lib. <hi>2.</hi> ch. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note>, which though due, cannot otherwiſe be obtained; or which cauſes them to ſuffer who have done wrong, ſo as it exceeds not the bounds of a juſt puniſhment. By vertue of this Right of acquiring things by a juſt War, <hi>Abraham offered unto God the tenth of the ſpoil he got from the five Kings</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 14.</note>, as the Author to the Hebrews ſeems to expound the ſtory<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 7.4.</note>. So alſo did the Grecians, the Carthaginians, and the Romans unto their Gods; as to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to <hi>Hercules,</hi> to <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> and others. The Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> leaving to <hi>Joſeph</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial Legacy above his Brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 48.22.</note> ſaith, <hi>Lo I give thee one part above thy Brothers, which I took from the Amorites with my Sword and with my Bow:</hi> where the word, <hi>cepi, I took,</hi> ſeems to be Prophetically ſpoken for, <hi>certo capiam, I ſhall ſurely take,</hi> (for ſo the Chaldee Paraphraſt expounds it, as if it had already been done by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prayers to God, who by his ſpecial favour preſerved <hi>Sichem</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity:) Where note alſo, that that is attributed unto <hi>Jacob</hi> which was done afterwards by his Poſterity, who were called by his name, as if he and they were but one and the ſame perſon; which place is better thus expounded, than to wreſt it (as the Hebrews do) to the ſpoil taken from the Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, which was long before done by the Sons of <hi>Jacob.</hi> For that, as being ſomewhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly done, the old Patriarch did conſcienciouſly diſclaim, as may be yet ſeen upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.30. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6. Now that this Right, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and others had unto the ſpoils taken in a juſt War, was approved of by God, ſo long as it was limited within the natural bounds preſcribed, will appear, not by this only, but by other the like places of the Scripture. God in the Law which he gives, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.14. concerning that City that ſhould refuſe to ſurrender, but was afterwards taken by the Sword, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt take the ſpoil of it to thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt enjoy the prey of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which the Lord hath given thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 5.20, 21, 22.</note> Again, <hi>The Rubenites, the Gadites, and a part of the Tribe of</hi> Manaſſes, <hi>are ſaid to have conquered the Itureans, and their Neighbours, and to have taken much ſpoil from them;</hi> this being given as the reaſon, <hi>becauſe in the fight they called

Which is the more notable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that War was not undertaken by any ſpecial command from God, but only out of common Right. <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo purſuing the ſame Rubenites, Gadites, and part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſites in their proſperous ſucceſſes, ſaith, <hi>Divide the ſpoil of your Enemies with your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Joſh. 22.8.

And <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew reckons it among the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Law, <hi>That their fields ſhould be reaped by their Enemies,</hi> whereby muſt neceſſarily enſue, Famine to themſelves and Plenty to their Enemies: Whereunto we may add, <hi>That God gave the ſpoil of</hi> Tyre <hi>to</hi> Nebuchadnezor <hi>for the pay of his Army,</hi> Ezech. 29.19, 20. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by him God puniſhed the Pride of the Tyrians for inſulting over <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezech.</hi> 26.2.</p>

                  <head>II. What the Law of Nations.</head>
                  <p>Moreover by the Law of Nations, not only he that makes War for a juſt cauſe, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in a ſolemn War, is without either end or meaſure owner of whatſoever he can take from an Enemy; namely, in that ſenſe, that both he, and whoſoever claims from him are to be defended in their poſſeſſions of the things ſo gained by all Nations: which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the external effects thereof may be called Dominion. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith <hi>Xenophon, is an everlaſting Law with all men, that a City being taken by force, all the goods and riches are the Conquerours. Plato</hi> likewiſe was of the ſame opinion, <hi>All that was the Conquereds,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bona quae victus habuit omnia victoris fiunt.</note> 
                     <hi>become after the Victory, the Conquerours.</hi> And elſwhere amongſt divers kinds of natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, he placeth this alſo which he calls ſometimes <hi>Polemical,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Predatory,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Certatory:</hi> Therein agreeing with <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who brings in <hi>Socrates</hi> by divers interrogations drawing <hi>Euthydemus</hi> to this confeſſion, That it was not at all times unjuſt to ſpoil and to deſtroy; as for example, when done againſt an Enemy. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt of his Politicks, ſaith, <hi>That the Law of Nations, as by an univerſal agreement had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that whatſoever is conquered from an Enemy by War becomes immediately the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi> To the like purpoſe is that of <hi>Antiphanes, We ought to wiſh our Enemies abundance of riches without valour; for ſo thoſe riches will quickly find other Maſters, not thoſe that poſſeſs them, but thoſe that can conquer them.</hi> For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves in the life of <hi>Alexander, What was the vanquiſheds, both is, amd ought to be accounted the Conquerours.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inſtit. Cyri. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> And elſewhere the ſame <hi>Plutarch, The goods of thoſe that are by War overcome, are propoſed as the reward of the victory;</hi> which are the very words of <hi>Xenophon. What is gained by Arms,</hi> ſaith <hi>Diodorus, or got by the right of War, ought not eaſily to be loſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Philip</hi> in his Epiſtle to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, ſaith, <hi>All of us poſſeſs Cities, which were either left us by our Anceſtors, or being ſubdued became ours by the right of War.</hi> Thus <hi>Aeſchines</hi> alſo, <hi>If by making War againſt us, thou hadſt ſubdued our City, thou mightest lawfully have poſſeſt it by the Law of Arms. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> in <hi>Livy</hi> juſtifies himſelf in taking the ſpoil of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> by the Right of conqueſt. And the Goths in <hi>Agathias,</hi> do by the ſame Law, juſtifie King <hi>Theudorick</hi> who had firſt conquered <hi>Odoazer,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Quae ejus fuerant omnia tenuit jure belli; Whatſoever</hi> Odoazer <hi>had,</hi> Theudorick <hi>poſſeſt by the right of War.</hi> Thus the Roman Embaſſadors told <hi>Philip</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the City of <hi>Thrace</hi> and ſome others, That if he had taken thoſe Cities by War, they had been his by the Law of Arms, as being the reward of his victory. And thus <hi>Maſſaniſſa</hi> pleads, ſaying, The land that his Father conquered by War from the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, he held by the Law of Nations. So alſo <hi>Mithridates</hi> in <hi>Juſtine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 38.</note> 
                     <hi>That to pleaſe the Romans he had withdrawn his Son out of</hi> Cappadocia, <hi>which as a Conquerour he was rightly poſſeſt of by the Law of Nations.</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us that the City <hi>Mitylene</hi> became the Romans by the Right of War and by Conqueſt. And in another place he tells us, That propriety in ſome things may be gained either by preoccupancy, or by War, as in thoſe things that are gained by Victory. Of the ſame mind was <hi>Dion Caſſius,</hi> All that was the Conquered's immediately becomes the Conquerours: <hi>Quae ex hoſtibus capiuntur jure genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſtatim capientium fiunt; Whatſoever,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cajus</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>is taken from an Enemy by the Law of Nations, immediately is made his that takes it.</hi> And this kind of acquiſition <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> calls a <hi>natural poſſeſſion.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

                  <head>III. When movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Goods are ſaid to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</head>
                  <p>Moreover, by the Law of Nations things are then ſaid to be taken in War, when they are ſo detained from us that we are deprived of any probable hopes to recover them, and are no longer able to purſue them; as <hi>Pomponius</hi> determines the like Queſtion. And this, in things moveable, is to be preſumed as ſoon as they are carried into the Enemies Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A thing may be ſaid to be loſt in the ſame manner as it is ſaid to return after it hath been loſt; but may be ſaid to return as ſoon as it comes within the Bounds of the Empire from whence it was taken, that is, as ſoon as it comes within our Garriſons. Nay, <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer doth plainly averr that man to be taken that is carried out of our Bounds. And <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius</hi> declares that man to be taken in War whom our Enemy, having apprehended from out of our Garriſons, had led into their own. For until he be ſecured within their Garriſons, he remains a Citizen or Subject of ours. Now by this Law of Nations there is the ſame reaſon for Goods as there is for Perſons, whereby we way eaſily conclude, That in ſome places things taken in War are preſently ſaid to be his, or theirs, that take them, that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition, That they continue in their poſſeſſion for ſuch a time. Whence it ſeems to follow, That at Sea, Ships and other Goods are then ſaid to be taken when they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into our Enemies Harbours, or to ſuch a place where their whole Navy rides; for then their remains no hopes of recovery. But by a later Law of Nations, eſpecially of theſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is thus judged, namely, If the things taken continue in the poſſeſſion of the Enemy twenty four hours, then are they accounted for loſt.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>IV. When Lands.</head>
                  <p>But it is not ſo with Lands. For they are not ſaid to be taken as ſoon as the enemy ſets down upon them. For though it be true that that part of the Land which an enemy with a ſtrong Army encamps upon, is by them for the preſent poſſeſt, as <hi>Celſus</hi> obſerves; yet is it not every poſſeſſion that is ſufficient to alienate the Title of Land, but ſuch a one as is firm and laſting. The Romans were ſo far from thinking that part of their Land loſt whereon <hi>Hannibal</hi> encamped, that at that very time they ſold it for as much as it would have given before. But that Land only is ſaid to be loſt that is ſo immured or ſecured with Walls, Forts, Rampires, and ſuch like Muniments; that unleſs the enemy that holds them can be driven away, there can be no poſſible acceſs unto it by the former Owners. And this derivation of the word Territory, which <hi>Siculus Flaccus</hi> gives, namely, <hi>A terren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis hoſtibus, From deterring the enemy from approaching unto it,</hi> ſeems to be as probable as either that aſſigned by <hi>Varro, à terendo, from wearing;</hi> or that of <hi>Frontinus, From the ſoil or earth;</hi> or that of <hi>Pomponius</hi> the Lawyer, From the power that the Magiſtrate of the place hath to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright all perſons within thoſe bounds by removing or driving them out of it. Thus <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his Book concerning Contribution ſaith, That the poſſeſſion of Lands is held in the time of war by Muniments, which he there calls Walls and Frontier Garriſons.</p>

                  <head>V. Things not the Enemies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by War.</head>
                  <p>Whence this alſo may be gathered, That before the War can transfer a Right unto us in any thing ſo taken, it is requiſite by the Law of Nations, that that Right ſhould firſt be in our enemies. For things depoſited or laid up within our Enemies Towns or Garriſons, whoſe right Owners are neither Subjects to our Enemies, nor have any hoſtile mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; cannot by War be made lawful prize, though we do conquer the place; as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, among many others, by that of <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> where he ſhews, That <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> being a City belonging to the Athenians, could not be lawful prize to King <hi>Philip</hi> by that War which he made with the Amphipolitans. Firſt, becauſe no reaſon could be given why the Athenians ſhould loſe their right, being no Enemies at that time to King <hi>Philip;</hi> and then, Becauſe this Right of changing properties by mere force would prove a matter of ſo dangerous a conſequence, that it ought not to be largely interpreted.</p>

                  <head>VI. Concerning Goods found in an Enemies Ship.</head>
                  <p>Wherefore that which is commonly ſaid, That Goods found in the Ships of our Enemies are adjudged to be the Enemies Goods, and conſequently are lawful prize, is not ſo to be underſtood as though it were a certain Law made by the Right of Nations, but becauſe it gives occaſion to a very great preſumption that they are ſo, which notwithſtanding by preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and evident proofs to the contrary may be daſh'd. And ſo it was long ſince adjudged in <hi>Holland</hi> in a full Senate during the War with the <hi>Hanſ-towns</hi> in the Year 1338. and from thence hath ſince paſt into a Law. Neither are the Ships of our Confederates forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though the Goods in them be an Enemies, unleſs it be ſo agreed with the conſent of the Maſters of the Ship. And ſo are the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, to be underſtood, which adjudge the Goods lawful prize, if the Ship be ſo; and the Ship lawful prize, if the Goods be ſo.

                  <head>VIII. That things ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Enemies are not always theirs that take them.</head>
                  <p>But here a more knotty Queſtion ariſeth, concerning the perſons to whom the ſpoils taken from the enemy in a ſolemn War belong, whether to the State, or to every perſon of, or among the people. The Modern Lawyers do vary exceedingly in their opinions concerning this Point; for moſt of them finding it in their Civil Law, That <hi>capta ſunt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientium; Things thus taken, are theirs that take them.</hi> And in the Body of the Canon Law, That the ſpoil is to be diſtributed by publick Authority, do one from another (as is uſual) deliver their opinions thus, That primarily, and by original Right, he that firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them hath the beſt title to them; but notwithſtanding that they are all to be brought to the General, who may diſtribute them amongſt his Souldiers. But this opinion is not more common than falſe; and therefore that we may hereby learn how unſafe it is in ſuch doubtful caſes to be biaſſed by ſo weak an Authority, I ſhall the more accurately confute this opinion. We cannot indeed deny but that by the conſent of Nations this Queſtion may be determined either way, namely, That the Spoil may belong either to the people, or to him that bears the charge of the War, or to thoſe particular perſons that with the hazard of their lives do firſt lay hands on it. But the Queſtion here is, Not what they may determine in this Point, but what they have or do determine of it; whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That the things of an enemy, by the conſent of Nations, are no otherwiſe their enemies that take them, than as they belong to none;</hi> as we have already explained it from that Saying of <hi>Nerva</hi> the Son.</p>

                  <head>IX. That poſſeſſion and dominion may be gained for us by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</head>
                  <p>But the things that are no Bodies, are indeed theirs that firſt take them. But they may be ſaid to take them that employ others to take them, as well as they who take them for and by themſelves. So they that are employed by others to catch Fiſh, Fowl, Deer, or Pearls, whether they be Children, Servants or Freemen, do not appropriate them unto themſelves, but take them for thoſe that employ them. It was well ſaid of <hi>Modestinus</hi> the Lawyer,<note place="margin">L. eaquae D. de acq. dom.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoever is naturally gained, as poſſeſſion is, may be gained by any man whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we will appoint to do it for us.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>Poſſeſſion is gained by the mind, and by the body, but then the mind muſt be our own; but the body may be either our own or anothers.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Poſſeſſion may be taken for us by either a Proctor, an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney or Guardian; that is, if it be done by them with that mind and purpoſe as to make it ours.</hi> Thus it was among the Grecians, they that overcame in the Olympian Games, obtained indeed the prize; but not for themſelves, but for thoſe that ſent them. And the reaſon is, becauſe naturally one man may make uſe of another as his Inſtrument, if both are willing. Wherefore the difference that is ſaid to be between perſons bond and free, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning acquiſitions, reſpects only the Civil Law, and appertains properly to civil acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as appears by that place of <hi>Modestinus</hi> before cited. And yet the Emperour <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> drew theſe nearer to the pattern of natural acquiſitions, not only for profit, as out of Juriſprudence, as he himſelf acknowledgeth. Setting then aſide the Civil Law, that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will hold good, That what a man may do for himſelf by himſelf, that he may alſo do by another; and it is the ſame thing to do it by another, as to do it by himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Here then we muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe acts which in a War are truly publick, and thoſe private acts that are done by the occaſion of a publick War. By theſe private acts the Goods of an Enemy may primarily and directly belong to the private Souldier; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is gained from an Enemy by ſuch acts as are publick, is due to the people, or to him that maintains the War.

                     <hi>is but just;</hi> though the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> gave the very Lands conquered from his Enemies unto the Captains and Souldiers of his Frontier Garriſons. Among the Hebrews and Lacedemonians the Land taken by War was divided by Lots amongſt the Tribes; yet ſo, that amongſt the Hebrews the Kings Lot was equal to that of each ſingle Tribe. Among the Romans, the Lands taken in War were either kept to be let out, ſome ſmall portion thereof being ſometimes left for honours ſake to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Owners; or alienated and ſold, or aſſigned over to Husbandmen to be ploughed or made tributary, whereof we have divers teſtimonies in their Hiſtories, Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. <hi>The Romans,</hi> (as <hi>Appian</hi> tells us) <hi>when they ſubdued</hi> Italy, <hi>took away part of their Fields by way of puniſhment.</hi> And elſewhere he tells us, <hi>That the Romans having conquered their Enemies did not take away all their Lands, but a part only.

                  <p>But as to things moving themſelves or moveable, they are taken either in publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or out of it. If they are ſuch as are not taken upon publick Duty, they are theirs that take them. And hither we may referr that of <hi>Celſus, Quae res hostiles apud nos ſunt, non publicae, ſed occupantium fiunt;</hi> Whatſoever is found amongſt us that was the enemies, belongs not to the Commonwealth, but to them that apprehend them; that is, the War being begun. For the very ſame was obſerved even of Men and Women at ſuch time as they in this caſe were equally valued with Goods. We have a notable Saying in <hi>Tryphonius</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>But they who in times of peace come to ſojourn in anothers dominions (as friends) the War ſuddenly breaking out, were made Slaves with them amongſt whom they were by their own hard fate apprehended as enemies.</hi> Where we may note, That the Lawyer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <hi>this</hi> unto Fate, becauſe they were brought into bondage without any merit of their own; for all ſuch were anciently aſcribed to Fate. So <hi>Servius</hi> upon that of <hi>Virgil, Acti

So <hi>Naevius</hi> concerning the <hi>Metelli, Fato fiunt Romae Metelli conſules; The</hi> Metelli <hi>were made Conſuls at</hi> Rome (as it were) <hi>by Fate,</hi> that is, without any merit of their own. In like manner it is, when Souldiers take any thing from their enemies whilſt they are not upon Duty, nor executing the Commands of their Captain, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Commanders, or by a promiſcuous licence that Souldiers do uſually take on each ſide one againſt another; what, I ſay, is ſo taken is lawful prize to him that takes it; becauſe it is not taken in order to any Command, but voluntarily, and is therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them as the reward of their valour. As when in pickeering a Souldier overcomes, diſarms or kills his Enemy, the ſpoil of that enemy is due unto him in recompence of his Virtue; ſo when a Party ſhall make an excurſion freely without Command into an enemies Country, ſo as it be beyond ten miles from the Camp, according to the Roman Diſcipline (as we ſhall ſee anon) whatſoever they ſhall ſo take is theirs that take it.</p>

                  <p>To give the ſpoil to the Souldiers, was by the Ancient Romans accounted as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Ambition. So <hi>Sextus</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud, but driven unto the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, is ſaid to diſtribute the prey amongſt the Souldiers, that thereby he might render himſelf the more powerful. <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> in the open Senate condemned ſuch kind of largeſſes to Souldiers, as ſavouring too much of novelty, raſhneſs, and prodigality:<note place="margin">Liv. l. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> The ſpoil given to the Souldiers, was either divided amongſt them, or taken, as when each man had what he could catch; when it was divided, either it was in lieu of their pay, in caſe it could not conveniently be reduced to money, and ſo brought into the publick Treaſury, and this was never oppoſed by <hi>Appius Claudius;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loco dicto.</note> or elſe it was divided accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every mans merits for ſervices then done. The order and method of this diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is excellently deſcribed by <hi>Polybius,</hi> namely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10.</note> the leſſer part of the Army was ſent out daily to fetch in the ſpoil, who were commanded to bring whatſoever they found into the Camp, where the Tribunes were equally to divide it. They that had the charge of the Camp, which from the practice of King <hi>David</hi> grew into a Law;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.24.</note> and they that through ſickneſs, or by reaſon of ſome publick employment were abſent, had equal ſhares with thoſe that were preſent: ſometimes the ſpoil was reduced into money,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Liv.</hi> 45.</note> which in lieu thereof was diſtributed among them; which in Triumphs was uſually done. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions I find to be thus divided, ſometimes to a Foot Souldier a ſingle ſhare, to a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Foot a double, to an Horſe-man a treble; and ſometimes to a Foot-man a ſingle, and to an Horſe-man a double proportion; elſwhere, a ſingle to a Foot Souldier, a double to the Captain: but to a Tribune, and to a Horſe-man (or rather to a Captain of Horſe, as <hi>Appianus</hi> relates) a quadruple ſhare. There was alſo ſometimes a reſpect had to the merits of Souldiers. Thus was <hi>Cajus Marcius,</hi> who had behaved himſelf gallantly, at the taking of <hi>Corioli</hi> highly rewarded for his valour out of the ſpoil of that City, before it was diſtributed among the Souldiers; but which way ſoever the ſpoil was to be divided, it was lawful for the General to take of the principal part of it, what he pleaſed unto himſelf, that is, as much as was ſit: which alſo hath ſometimes been granted unto others, as the reward, or an encouragement to valour.

For it is frequently ſeen, that <hi>they that are moſt backwards to fight, are moſt forwards to plunder; whereas they that have magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly expoſed themſelves to the greateſt labour and danger, have reaſon to expect the beſt part of the prey,</hi> which are the very words of <hi>Appius</hi> in <hi>Livy.</hi> Whereunto not very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi>

                     <hi>In this way of partition,</hi> I mean by plunder, <hi>I very well know that the worſt Souldiers get moſt:</hi> But unto this, it is commonly anſwered, That what any man takes from his Enemy with his own hands, is ever more acceptable unto him, than that which is aſſigned him by others, though in value it be much leſs. Sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it is permitted Souldiers to plunder, becauſe indeed it cannot eaſily be prevented. So it was in the winning of <hi>Cortuoſa</hi> a Town of the <hi>Hetruſcians, The Tribunes ordered the ſpoil to be ſold: but</hi> Imperium quàm conſilium ſegnius fuit; <hi>The command came too late; for

                     </note> That in all the Wars wherein the Romans ſhould engage them, the ſpoil taken from the Enemy ſhould be equally divided between them. So in the Wars wherein the Aetolians engaged the Romans, it was agreed,<note place="margin">Dionyſ. l. <hi>6.</hi> Polyb. l. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> That the Cities and Territories ſhould be the Aetolians, but the Priſoners and all Moveables ſhould be granted to the Romans.

And in ver. 47. he ſubdivides that part which belonged to the Congregation, and gave the fiftieth part thereof to the Levites, that had the charge of the Tabernacle. Thus <hi>David</hi> divided the ſpoil taken from the Amalekites equally, between them that went down to Battel, and them that guarded the Stuff. Sometimes the Jews would divide the ſpoil,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.24.</note> and grant half to the Souldiers; and as to the other part, they admitted the maimed, the Widows and the Orphans to have ſhare with them. So we read of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers,<note place="margin">2 Mac. 28.30.</note> that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways challenged the ſpoil taken from private men unto themſelves, only the moſt precious things they reſerved and preſented to the King. Wherefore we find them accuſed for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the publick Treaſury, who had conſpired to aſſume all the prey taken at <hi>Arbela</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as to bring nothing to the Treaſury. But yet thoſe publick things that belonged to the enemy, or to the King againſt whom they fought, were exempted from this Licence. Thus it was with the Macedonians when they brake into <hi>Darius</hi>'s Camp, they carried away an infinite Maſs of Treaſure, leaving no place unrifled, but the Kings Pavilion only; <hi>it being a cuſtom received amongſt them</hi> (as <hi>Curtius</hi> notes) <hi>as well as amongſt moſt Nations, to receive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour in the Pavilion of the conquered.</hi> The cuſtom of the Hebrews was not much unlike this of the Macedonians;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.30.</note> For they always ſet the Crown of the vanquiſhed King upon the head of the Conqueror, aſſigning all the Furniture of the Kings Palace or Pavilion unto him, as his ſhare of the ſpoil. And amongſt the Acts of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> we find that having conquered the Hungarians, <hi>Whatſoever was taken from private men, he gave to the Souldiers; but what was the vanquiſht Kings, was brought into the Emperour's Treaſury.</hi> The Grecians diſtinguiſhed them by their ſeveral names, calling the publick <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>What hitherto hath been ſaid, ſerves to this end, That if in any Nation, not embroiled with War, any Suit or Controverſie ariſe concerning any thing taken in War, the things ſhall be adjudged unto him to whom the Laws and Cuſtoms of that people from whoſe parts they were taken, ſhall determine. But if nothing can be thereby proved, then by the common right of Nations the thing ſo taken ſhall be adjudged to the State or people themſelves, if at leaſt it were taken in the act of War. For by what we have already ſaid it is plain,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> that what <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſometimes ſaid in the behalf of the Thebans doth not always prove true.

                  <p>But whatſoever is not the enemies, though it be found with the enemy, ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to them that take it. For this, as I have already ſaid, is neither agreeable to the Law of Nature, nor was introduced by the Law of Nations.

This alſo is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times controverted, Whether perſons or Goods taken without the Territories of either of thoſe Princes or people that are at War againſt each other, be theirs that take them.

                  <head>V. The reaſon why this Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</head>
                  <p>Now all this unlimited Power is by the Law of Nations granted for no other Cauſe than that the Conquerour being allured by ſo many advantages might be willing to forbear that utmoſt cruelty which they may lawfully uſe by killing their Captives, either in the heat of fight, or afterwards in cold blood. <hi>The name of ſervant,</hi> as <hi>Pomponius</hi> tells us, <hi>did at first ariſe from the cuſtom of Generals who ſold their Captives, and thereby preſerved them from being ſlain; (Servi quaſi ſervati:)</hi> That they may be the more willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, I ſay, for it is no bargain or agreement, whereby they ſtand obliged to ſave them, if we reſpect the Law of Nations; but a perſwaſive argument drawn from profit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far more beneficial to the Conquerour to ſell his Priſoner then to kill him. And therefore he hath the ſame power to transfer his Right in his Captive to another, as he hath to aſſign over unto others the Right and property he hath in any of his own Goods or Chattels. This Power is alſo extended to the Children that are born after Captivity, becauſe if the Conquerour had uſed his power to the utmoſt, they had not been born. From whence it follows, That the Child that is born before that Captivity, in caſe he be not taken Priſoner, remains free. Therefore by the Law of Nations, the Children born of ſuch Captives follow the Mothers condition, becauſe their Chaſtity is not provided for by any Law, nor is there any ſtrait guard kept upon them; and therefore no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption how great ſoever is ſufficient to prove who is the Father. And thus is that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> to be underſtood, <hi>Lex Naturae haec est, ut qui naſcitur, ſine legitimo matrimonio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem ſequatur; The Law of Nature is this, That he that is born without lawfull marriage, ſhould follow the condition of the Mother:</hi> that is, General cuſtom grounded on ſome Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon hath moulded this into a Law (<note n="*" place="margin">See ſecond Book, ch. 13. §. 26.</note>abuſively ſometimes ſo taken, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready elſewhere ſhewn) they that are born out of wedlock ſhould retain the name and quality of the Mother, and not of the Father, becauſe of the certainty of the one, and the uncertainty of the other. But that this unlimited Power over Captives was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the general conſent of Nations in vain, we may collect from the uſual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Civil Wars, wherein all Priſoners are commonly put to the ſword, becauſe they cannot be ſold for ſlaves,<note place="margin">Lib.

For the Law of Nations hath in this caſe equalled the condition of men with goods: So <hi>Cajus</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>Thoſe things that are taken from the Enemy are by the Law of Nations theirs that take them; ſo that even ſuch as were free men are by this Law reduced into bondage.</hi>

                  <p>Neither can I concur in Opinion with thoſe Divines who hold, That Captives taken in an unjuſt War, or ſuch as are born of them, are obliged in conſcience not to make their eſcape, unleſs it be to their own Garriſons, for herein I believe they err; ſurely in this lies the difference, if they can fly and make it good to their own Garriſons, whilſt the War laſts,<note place="margin">

But in caſe they make their eſcape to others, or unto their own Country after the Peace made, being re-demanded they are to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But yet from hence it follows not, that the Captives themſelves are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to return; for there are many Laws which bind only as to the outward judgement, which do not at all reſtrain the conſcience; and ſuch are theſe of War whereof we now diſcourſe: neither is it much to the purpoſe to ſay, that the very nature of Dominion doth of it ſelf induce ſuch an obligation; becauſe there being many kinds of Dominion, poſſible it is, that ſuch there are as are of force only in humane judgement, and ſo long only as the coercive Power laſts, which is frequently ſeen in other kinds of Right. Such in ſome ſort alſo is that Law that makes void ſome Teſtaments, becauſe, forſooth, they want ſome formalities which the Civil Law requires; whereas the more probable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that what is bequeathed by ſuch a Teſtament, may with a good conſcience be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:49430:187"/> ſo long (at leaſt) as nothing appears to contradict it. And not much different is his Right, who hath according to the Civil Laws unfaithfully preſcribed to anothers Eſtate; for by the judgment of thoſe Laws, even this mans Title ſhall be defended, untill it be made void by another ſentence of the ſame Law. And thus is that riddle of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> reſolved, <hi>Is it not just</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that every man ſhould enjoy his own,</hi>

For the Right of laying claim to a Captive, of forcing him, of binding him, and poſſeſſing what he hath, or can do, is of it ſelf motive ſufficient to perſwade the Conquerours, that it is a greater advantage to them to keep them alive than to kill them. But in caſe this cannot move the Conquerours, ſurely, no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be laid upon the conſcience can do it, which notwithſtanding he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by requiring either his verbal or ſacramental engagement, if he think it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Yet <hi>if the Captive can make an eſcape, and carry with him ſome Goods,</hi>

From whence this alſo appears, That a man being taken in an unjuſt War, and brought within the Power of the Enemy, cannot in his conſcience be guilty of theft, though he do, as I ſaid before, carry away with him ſomewhat that was his own; or though not his own, yet that is due unto him as the reward of his labour: If at leaſt he have reſerved any thing beſides his ſuſtenance, provided that he himſelf owe nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either his Lord, or him from whom his Lord claims his Right unto him.

                  <p>IT is no marvel that he who can bring into ſubjection every particular perſon, can alſo ſubdue the Body Politick, whether it be a City, or part of a City, and whether that ſubjection be merely civil, or merely deſpotical, or mixt. This Argument we ſhall find uſed by <hi>Seneca</hi> in that Controverſie which is <hi>de Olynthio,</hi> where he brings in one pleading thus, <hi>He is my Slave whom I bought by the right of War; and very expedient it is for you, O ye Athenians, not only to acknowledge my Title to be juſt, but to defend it; otherwiſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all your great Conquests, your Empire alſo must be confined within your ancient Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> acknowledgeth, That Empires are gained by Armes, but enlarged by Conqueſts. So likewiſe <hi>Quintilian,</hi> Kingdoms, Nations, and the Bounds of Cities and Countries, are determined by the Rights of War. <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Curtius</hi> claims by this Right, ſaying, That Laws are uſually given by the Conquerour, and received by the Conquered.

So <hi>Alexander</hi> after the Battel at <hi>Gaugamela</hi> was ſaluted King of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And the Romans alſo claimed unto themſelves all that was <hi>Syphax</hi>'s by the Right of War. But when the Huns plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Romans, That the Country of the <hi>Gepidae</hi> was theirs, becauſe they had taken their King Priſoner: the Romans denied it, becauſe the <hi>Gepidae</hi> were governed by a Prince rather than by a King; for that the Kingdom was not Patrimonial. And therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That he could not loſe more than what was his own. Or it may alſo be gained, as it is in the people; and then the Conquerour hath as much power to alienate it as the people had; and thus do ſome Kingdoms become Patrimonial, as I have elſewhere ſaid.<note place="margin">Book 1.

                  <p>Now as whatſoever any particular Priſoner had when he was taken, was by the Law of Arms his or theirs that took him; ſo whatſoever belongs to the people in general is his or theirs that ſubdue them, if they will take it. For what <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith of ſuch as ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, namely, <hi>All are given up to the Conquerour; ſo that what he will take to himſelf, and wherein and how far forth he will puniſh the Conquered, is wholly in his own power.</hi> The very ſame in a Solemn War may be ſaid of thoſe that are conquered. Thus <hi>Polybius, They that yield themſelves up to the Romans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Book 1. Chap. 4, Sect. 8. Book 2. Ch. 5. Sect. 31. Book 3. Ch. 5. Sect. 2. and Ch. 20. Sect. 49. <hi>Vid. Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</note> 
                     <hi>do yield up in the firſt place their Country, and what Towns and Cities ſoever are therein, together with all their Men and Women that are in them; then all their Rivers and Ports, and generally all things ſacred and religious: ſo that the Romans are Lords of all, and they that thus ſurrender themſelves have nothing left.</hi> And the ſelf ſame Right hath the Conquerour over thoſe that are actually conquered in a ſolemn War. For dedition doth but voluntarily yield up that which otherwiſe would be taken away by force. <hi>Hannibal</hi> encourageth his Souldiers, being ready for Battel, with this Argument, <hi>Whatſoever the Romans have by ſo many Conquests got and heaped up, ſhall together with themſelves be ours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Victory.</hi> Thus all that <hi>Mithridates</hi> had by force of Armes added to his own, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> by ſubduing him annexed to the Roman Empire; wherefore even thoſe incorporeal Right which formerly belonged to the whole Body of the people, are now by the Law of Armes the Conquerours, ſo far forth as he pleaſeth. Thus <hi>Alba</hi> being ſubdued, what Rights ſoever the Albans enjoyed were claimed by the Romans. Whence it follows, That the Theſſalians ſtood fully diſcharged of the hundred Talents for which they ſtood bound to the Thebans, when <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> conquering the Thebans, had by the Right of Conqueſt forgiven the Debt. Neither is that altogether true that <hi>Quintilian</hi> urgeth in the defence of the Thebans, namely, That that only is the Conquerours which he can lay hold on. But that Right which is incorporeal cannot be apprehended by any mans hand; and again, That the condition of an Heir is one thing, and that of a Conquerour is another; becauſe to the Heir may paſs the Right, but to the Conquerour the thing: For he that is Maſter of the perſons, is alſo Maſter of the Eſtate, and of all the rights belonging to the perſons. He that is himſelf poſſeſt as a Slave, cannot be ſaid to poſſeſs any thing to himſelf; neither can he have any thing in his power to diſpoſe of, who hath no power to diſpoſe of himſelf: yea, though the Conquerour do grant unto the conquered <hi>Jus Civitatis, The Right of being a City;</hi> yet may he take away and reſerve to himſelf whatſoever he pleaſeth out of what was the Cities. It is in his own power to preſcribe what bounds he will to his own bounty. Thus <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in imitation of that Fact of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s to the Theſſalians, forgave a very great Debt to the Dyrrhachines, which they owed to another City of the adverſe part. But here it might have been objected, That that War of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was not of the ſame kind with that concerning which this Law of Nations was inſtituted. So alſo we read that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> commanded the Tyrians to reſtore unto the Jews what belonged unto them, as not being granted unto them by the Roman Senate, and whereof they were poſſeſt before the War made with <hi>Caſſius;</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates it.</p>

                  <p>THERE are none of our modern Lawyers, who have written any thing ſolidly, either concerning things taken from the Enemy, or concerning the Rights due unto them, who having been taken Priſoners, yet have either by favour, force, or fraud, eſcaped and got home again. The Ancient Romans have handled this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomewhat more accurately, but yet oft-times ſo confuſedly, that the Reader cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between what is due by the Roman Civil Law, and what is due by the Law of Nations. Concerning the word <hi>Poſtliminium,</hi> that opinion of <hi>Servius</hi> is to be exploded, who held, that the latter part of the word ſignified nothing. That of <hi>Scaevola</hi> pleaſeth better, who makes it a compound word, of <hi>poſt</hi> which ſignifies a return, or coming from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, and <hi>Limen,</hi> or <hi>Limes,</hi> which ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gnifies properly the threſhold of an Houſe, or the utmoſt bounds or frontiers of a Country: for <hi>Limen</hi> and <hi>Limes,</hi> though they differ no leſs in flection, than in termination, as <hi>Materia</hi> and <hi>Materies;</hi> yet are they both deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that old Verb <hi>Limo,</hi> which ſignifies tranſverſe or overthwart,<note place="margin">Aenead. l. <hi>12.</hi> Eunuch.</note> as <hi>Servius</hi> upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> upon <hi>Terence</hi> obſerve; from whence <hi>Limes oculis aliquem intueri,</hi> is, <hi>to look a ſquint upon a man:</hi> Though by the latter uſe of the word, <hi>Limen</hi> be referred to things private, and <hi>Limes</hi> to things publick, as to the bounds or borders of Kingdoms. For, as <hi>Iſidore</hi> notes, all oblique or croſs-ways, the Ancients called <hi>Lima:</hi> from whence, <hi>the threſholds of doors</hi> over which we go in and out, are called <hi>Limina oſtiorum.</hi> So the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients when they baniſhed any man, were ſaid <hi>eliminare, to thruſt him beyond their marches;</hi> and baniſhment they called <hi>Eliminium, a thruſting out of their bounds and Territories.</hi>

                  <p>Poſtliminy therefore is a Right that ariſeth unto a man that was a Captive upon his return from Captivity; that is, upon his entring within the Frontiers of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So <hi>Pomponius,</hi> He is ſaid to be returned out of Captivity that begins to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our own Garriſons; or as <hi>Paulus</hi> ſaith, that enters within the bounds of our Territories. But by a parity of reaſon, it is by the general conſent of Nations grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Right of Poſtliminy takes place, as ſoon as the perſon that was a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or any other thing that is capable of this Right, ſhall come within the Guards or Garriſons of our friends and Aſſociates, as <hi>Pomponius</hi> ſpeaks; or as <hi>Paulus</hi> expounds it by way of example, as ſoon as he ſhall enter into any Garriſon that belongs unto ſuch a King or State, as are our friends and companions in the ſame War. For ſo indeed are theſe words (Friends and Aſſociates) here to be underſtood, not of any Nation or King with whom we are at peace, but of ſuch only as are ſo Confederate with us that they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſame War, into whoſe Garriſons whoſoever enters out of Captivity, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his former Rights, and be defended upon the publick account. It matters not much whether they that ſo return are men or things, or whether they come into our Garriſons, or the Garriſons of our Aſſociates: But in caſe they that are taken Captives, ſhall fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dominions of our Neighbour King, who though at Peace with us, is not aſſociated with us in the ſame War, they ſhall not change their condition of being Priſoners; unleſs it were before ſo expreſly agreed, as it was between the Romans and the Carthaginians in their ſecond League, That if any of the friends of the Romans, being taken by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:49430:190"/> could eſcape out of any peoples Territories that were friends to the Romans, into any of their Ports or Cities that were Subjects to the Romans, they might enjoy their liberty;<note place="margin">Val.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ſome of the Romans, being taken in the ſecond Punick War, were ſold by way of Traffick into <hi>Greece;</hi> they were not admitted to enjoy this Right of Poſtliminy, becauſe the Grecians in that War ſtood Neuters: and therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould be firſt ranſomed before they could be ſet at liberty; yea, and although <hi>Flaminius,</hi> having conquered King <hi>Philip,</hi> had ſet all the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> at liberty, yet would he not take away from their Maſters by force thoſe Roman Captives, which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſold by the Carthaginians unto the Grecians; but the Achaians to gratifie him for their liberty, bought Twelve hundred of them who were diſperſed though <hi>Greece,</hi> and preſented them to <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who received them as a Preſent of great value. So did the Rhodians buy the Athenian Captives,<note place="margin">Polyb. except. Leg. n. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> taken in the War that King <hi>Philip</hi> made in <hi>Greece,</hi> and frankly reſtored them to the Athenians. And in <hi>Homer</hi> we read of divers perſons taken in War, that were ſold into ſuch Countries that were in Peace.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Ancient Romans did always account thoſe that were received out of Captivity as freemen.</hi> Gallus Aelius <hi>in his firſt Book of the ſignifications of Law Terms, ſaith,</hi> That he who being free of one City did voluntarily depart to another, and afterwards did return back into that City, whereof he was at the firſt made free, was ſaid to be <hi>Poſtliminio recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> that is, admitted to his old freedom by that Law, which provides for ſuch as return out of Captivity. As alſo in caſe a ſervant being taken from us, and carried Captive into our Enemies Garriſon, ſhould afterwards return unto us, he may by this Law of Poſtliminy place himſelf under his old Maſter. So Horſes, Mules, and Ships, by a parity of reaſon, had the ſame right of reception as ſervants. And look what kind of things do teturn unto us by this right, the very ſame may return from us to our Enemies. <hi>But the Ancient Roman Lawyers have more diſcreetly admitted but of two ſorts of Poſtliminy; as namely, when we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return, or receive ſomething that is returned.</hi>

                  <head>IV. It is of uſe as well in Peace as War.</head>
                  <p>Neither may we altogether reject that of <hi>Trophonius;</hi> namely that this Right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning out of Captivity into Freedom, may be of uſe as well in Peace as War, though in a little different ſenſe than as <hi>Pomponius</hi> expreſſeth it. This Right of Poſtliminy in Peace, appertains unto thoſe who were not conquered in War by force of Arms; but were through misfortune ſurpriſed within the Enemies Territories, when the War unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly brake forth. But to other Captives there belongs no ſuch Right in times of Peace, unleſs it be otherwiſe agreed on by both parties at the making of the Peace, as it was at the concluſion of the War between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Bacchides</hi> recorded by <hi>Joſephus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ant. l. <hi>13.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Polybius</hi> among other Articles of the Peace concluded and agreed on between King <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> recites this, That all Priſoners taken on either ſide (the Aetolians only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) ſhould be ſet at liberty. Thus we read that <hi>Probus</hi> made Peace with the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Burgundians, upon this condition, <hi>That all the prey they had taken, together with the Priſoners ſhould be reſtored.</hi> Nay ſometimes it is agreed, That not only thoſe Priſoners that belong to private men, but thoſe that belong to the Commonwealth are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> teſtifies. Now this is plainly evinced, as well by the ſubſequent reaſon, as by its oppoſite member, <hi>The Peace was concluded, and the Priſoners releaſed, for,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zonaras, ſo it was agreed.</hi> It was then by vertue of the agreement, and not ſimply by their making of Peace, that their Captives were diſmiſt. So <hi>Pomponius, If the Captive concerning whom it was agreed in the Articles of the Peace, that he might return home, ſhall notwithſtanding chuſe to remain with the Enemy, he ſhall not afterwards claim this right of Poſtliminy.</hi> So alſo <hi>Paulus, If a Priſoner taken in War when the Peace is made, ſhall fly away and come home, he ſhall be made to return back to him, who in the War took him Priſoner; becauſe in the Articles of Peace it was not mentioned, that the Priſoners ſhould be releaſed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</note> Now the reaſon why the Romans ſeemed ſo to neglect their Priſoners, is <hi>becauſe they would have them to place all their hopes of returning back in their valour, rather than in a Peace.</hi> For thus doth <hi>Livy</hi> teſtifie of them, That <hi>Rome</hi> was a City, that of old was in <hi>Captivos minime indulgens, very regardleſs of their Captives.</hi> But this reaſon being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to the Romans, could not of it ſelf conſtitute the Law of Nations; it might notwithſtanding ſerve as one cauſe amongſt others, for which the Romans did the more willingly embrace that Law which was before introduced by other Nations. But a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſon may be this, becauſe all Princes and States making War would willingly be believed that there Cauſe was juſt; and on the contrary, that they that took Arms againſt them did the wrong. Now whilſt both parties are thus perſwaded, it would not be ſafe for any other Prince or State that would live in peace to judge between them; therefore they conclude it better to ſit ſtill, and to eſteem whatſoever ſhould be done in that War to be juſt, and ſo the Priſoners on either ſide taken in actual Armes to be lawfully taken. But now againſt thoſe Priſoners, that have been by misfortune ſurprized through the ſuddain eruption of the War, no ſuch thing can be alledged; for they have neither adviſed nor

                     </gap>urt to us. Nevertheleſs to weaken the power of the enemy, becauſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is that they might be inticed to injure us, it hath been thought not unjuſt to detain them during the War; but the War being ended, there can be nothing alledged why they ſhould not be releaſed: and therefore it is generally conſented unto by all Nations, That ſuch Priſoners, when the Peace is made, ſhould be enlarged, as being confeſt by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties innocent. But as to other Priſoners, every man that uſurps a Right over them, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that he ſhould be believed that he hath juſtly gained them, unleſs by ſome preceding Agreements he be limited. And for this Cauſe neither Captives nor any thing elſe taken in War, is to be reſtored in Peace, unleſs it be ſo expreſt in the Articles of Peace, becauſe the Conquerour would be thought to have a juſt Title to them, which to contradict, were to renew the War: and therefore <hi>Totilas</hi> in <hi>Procopius</hi> charges <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who was ſent unto him from the Romans, that he ſhould not mention the releaſing of the Sicilian Captives; urging that it was not equitable that the Romans ſhould redeliver their Fellow-Souldiers to their old Maſters. Wherefore the Agreement brought by <hi>Quintilian</hi> in the behalf of the Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bans, is rather witty than ſolid, namely, That Priſoners it they can make their eſcape into their own Country, the War being ended, are to be reckoned as Freemen; becauſe what is gotten by force, is no longer ours than we can keep it by force. Concerning thoſe that make their eſcapes after the Peace is concluded, we have hitherto treated: now in the time of War they are ſaid to return by Poſtliminy to their former freedom, who were free before they were taken Captives in the War; but they are ſaid to be received, who before were not free, as Servants and other things.</p>

                  <p>But a Freeman being returned home, doth not only recover his own freedom, but all things elſe that were his in any Nation that is at peace, whether they are things corporeal or incorporeal; becauſe, though people that are at peace, as they do not enquire into the juſtneſs of the War, but take every thing that is done to the Captive to be juſt: ſo when they ſee the Captive to be at liberty, they diſpute not the manner how, but take it as granted that he was releaſed juſtly, whereby they ſhew themſelves indifferent to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wherefore he that by the Law of Arms is poſſeſt of a Captive, hath not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and indubitable Right unto all things that belong to him. For it is poſſible that his right may ſurceaſe without or againſt his will, that if the Priſoner can make his eſcape, and return into his own Country; for then juſt ſo as he loſeth his right to the Man, doth he loſe his title to thoſe Goods which were his. But what if thoſe Goods be alienated, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he that derived his title to them from him who at that time was by the right of War the Owner of them, be defended by the Law of Nations, or ſhall the ſame thing ſo alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated be recovered? Thoſe Goods, I mean, that are extant among ſuch people as ſtand Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the War. Here then we are to diſtinguiſh between ſuch things as may return by Poſtliminy, and ſuch as are uncapable of this right; the difference whereof we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently explain, That the former may appear to be alienated during their Cauſe only, and under this Condition, That the perſon be ſtill held in cuſtody: theſe latter, ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.

But if the very Body of the people that conſtituted that City be diſſolved, I believe that they that ſucceed are not to be accounted the ſame people; neither are thoſe things that formerly belonged to that City to be reſtored unto them by this Right of Poſtliminy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Right of Nations; becauſe a Nation, like a Ship, by the diſſolution of its parts, doth abſolutely periſh: for that its whole Nature conſiſts in the perpetual Conjunction of all its M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Wherefore it was not the ſame City of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> though the place where it formerly ſtood were reſtored unto the ancient Inhabitants eight years after its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Neither was <hi>Thebes</hi> the ſame City after that <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſold the Citizens for Slaves: whence it follows, That what the Theſſalians owed unto the Thebans before ſuch diſſolution, could not juſtly be claimed by thoſe Thebans by Poſtliminy; and that for a double reaſon, Firſt, Becauſe they were then a new people; ſecondly, Becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> whilſt he was Lord over them, had a power to alienate that Right, and accordingly had done it: and laſtly, A Debt is not to be reckoned among thoſe things which return by Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminy. Not much unlike to what we have ſaid concerning Cities, is that which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Roman Laws concluded of Marriages, namely, That they were by captivity diſſolved, neither could they be reſtored by poſtliminy, but muſt be redintigrated by the firſt conſent of both parties.

                  <head>X. To thoſe that return, what Rights ariſe from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law.</head>
                  <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it is no hard matter to underſtand what manner of right by the Law of Nations, Poſtliminy gives to free men. Moreover, this very ſame right may by the Civil Law, ſo far as it belongs to things agitated within the City, be both reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by adding ſome exceptions or conditions, and alſo enlarged unto other profits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as occaſion ſerves. As by the Roman Civil Law Fugitives are exempted out of the number of thoſe that were capable of this right; ſo were alſo the Sons of a Family, over whom the Father was conceived not to have loſt that Paternal power and authority which was peculiar to the Romans; and that for this reaſon, as <hi>Paulus</hi> obſerves, Becauſe to Roman Parents their Military Diſcipline was ever dearer than their own Children; whereunto agrees that which <hi>Cicero</hi> records of <hi>Manlius, That he ſtrictly upheld the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Roman Empire, though to his own grief, that ſo he might the better provide for the ſafety of the City, wherein was alſo bound up his own; which made him prefer the Sovereign Right of Majeſty, which was then in himſelf, before the bonds of Nature, or the tenderneſs of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards his own Son.</hi> Again, ſome diminution of this Right of Poſtliminy, is that which was ordained, firſt, by the Athenians, and afterwards by the Romans, namely, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t qui redemptus est ab hoſtibus, Redemptori ſerviat donec pretium reddiderit; That he that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, ſhould ſerve his Redeemer until he ſhould have repaid his ranſome.</hi> But this was made in favour to the poor Captives, leſt if there ſhould be no proviſion made for the recovery of the money ſo paid, many Priſoners ſhould have been left in perpetual ſlavery among their enemies. But yet even this very ſlavery was many ways mitigated by the Roman Laws, and at length by the laſt Law of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> it was limited to five years ſervice; neither could the money paid for his redemption be recoverable after the death of the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. So alſo by any Contract of Marriage between the perſon redeemed, and the perſon redeeming, it was adjudged to be forgiven. So if it were a Woman that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, if the Redeemer did proſtitute her Body, the ranſome was loſt. There were many other Laws made among the Romans in favour to thoſe that would redeem Priſoners, and to puniſh their Kinſmen for neglecting them. Again, this Right of Poſtliminy was by the Civil Law much enlarged, in that not only thoſe Rights in Poſtliminy which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the Law of Nations, are granted unto him that ſo returns; but generally all things and all Rights are as intirely his, as if he had never been within the power of the enemy. And this was alſo the Attick Law: for as we read in <hi>Dion Pruſaeenſis,</hi> A certain man pretending to be the Son of <hi>Callias,</hi> who had been taken Priſoner in the Slaughter at
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:49430:191"/> 
                     <hi>Acanthus,</hi> and, as he ſaid, been kept as a Priſoner in <hi>Thrace,</hi> when he had made his eſcape to <hi>Athens,</hi> claimed by Poſtliminy his inheritance from thoſe that then had the poſſeſſion thereof after his Father; we do not read that any thing was pleaded againſt his Right, only it came in iſſue, Whether he were the Son of <hi>Callias,</hi> or not. The ſame Authour likewiſe relates, That the Meſſenians after long captivity, at length returning, received both their liberty and Country. Yea, and thoſe things which either by uſucapion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ſeemed to be taken away out of the Goods, or through diſuſe, to be deſerted, are all of them recovered by a Reſciſſory Action. For under the Edict of making reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Anceſtors, he alſo who is under the power of Enemies, is comprehended. Nay farther; the Cornelian Law provides for the Heirs of ſuch as dye in captivity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all their Goods as lawfully as if he that returned not, were at that very time when he was taken, dead. Now were it not for theſe Civil Laws, without doubt as ſoon as any man were taken Priſoner by the enemy, his Goods would preſently be theirs that had them in poſſeſſion; becauſe, <hi>Qui apud hoſtes eſt, pro nullo habetur; He that is under the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies power is held for none.</hi> And then, if he that was taken ſhould return, he ſhould receive nothing but ſuch things as by the Law of Nations were due unto him by Poſtliminy. But that the Goods of a Captive were confiſcate and brought into the Treaſury, in caſe he had no Heir, was a Law peculiar to the Romans only. Hitherto we have treated of things that return, now we ſhall ſpeak of ſuch things as are received by Poſtliminy.</p>

                  <head>XI. How Servants are received by Poſtliminy, how Fugitives, and how they that are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</head>
                  <p>Amongſt which, in the firſt place, are Bondmen and Bondwomen, yea even ſuch oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as have been alienated, and ſuch as have been ſet at liberty by the enemy; becauſe (as it is very well noted by <hi>Tryphoninus</hi>) it is not juſt that his former Maſter being our Citi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zen, ſhould be damnified by the Right of an Enemy. By an Edict of King <hi>Theuderick</hi> it was ordained, <hi>That Servants and Tenants being taken by the enemy, and returning home, ſhould be reſtored to their own Lords, if they were not before bought by ſome other from the enemy by way of traffick.</hi> But by the wiſe Gothick Law, a Servant recovered by War was reſtored to his Maſter, he paying unto him that took him the third part of his juſt price. But in caſe the Servant were ſold by the Enemy, then was the Lord to pay the full price for which he was ſold with ſome advantage. Therefore that a Servant may be capable of reception, it is neceſſary that his old Maſter ſhould be either actually poſſeſt of him, or at leaſt that the Servant be where he may eaſily have him, if he ſo pleaſeth. And therefore whereas in other things it may ſuffice, That they are brought within the Bounds of our own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, this is not ſufficient in a Servant to receive the right of Poſtliminy, unleſs it be alſo made known to his Maſter that he is there. For as <hi>Paulus</hi> ſaith, If he lye ſculking in <hi>Rome,</hi> and will not be ſeen nor known to be there, he is not yet received by this Law. And as herein Servants differ from things inanimate, ſo do they from the caſe of a Freeman in this, That it is not required in them to make them capable of being received, that they ſhould return with an intent to follow the fortune of the City whereunto they return; for this is required from him only that is to receive his own freedom, and not of him that is to be received by another.<note place="margin">Sabinus.</note> For <hi>every man hath a free power to make himſelf a Member of what City he pleaſeth, but not of the Right of Dominion.</hi> Neither do the Roman Laws exempt Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive<note place="margin">Fugitives.</note> Servants from this right of reception: for even in theſe may their old Maſters claim their Right, as <hi>Paulus</hi> notes; leſt if we ſhould admit the contrary, it ſhould prove injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not to the Servant, who nevertheleſs is ſtill to remain a Servant, but to the Maſter who would want his ſervice. But generally, concerning ſuch Captives as are redeemed by the valour of Souldiers, that may be truly ſaid by their Generals, which ſome would ſo wreſt, as if it were meant of all things, <hi>Receptos eos non captos judicare debemus, &amp; Militem noſtrum defenſorem eorum decet eſſe non dominum; We are to eſteem of theſe not as taken, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whom we ought rather to defend and protect, than inſult over.</hi> Thoſe Captives that are ranſomed from the enemy, are by the Roman Laws theirs that redeem them; but the Summ paid being tendered, they are underſtood to be by Poſtliminy received. But by the more recent Laws ſome things have been changed; and that Servants being taken may be encouraged to return, they now propoſe preſent liberty to ſuch as have been maimed in their ſervice, and to the reſt after five years, as appears by their Military Laws, collected by <hi>Rufus.</hi>

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49430:192"/> appears plainly that they are not able to recover it again. Thus the Iſland <hi>Aegina</hi> which the Lacedemonians took from the Athenians, they reſtored to their Aſſociates who were the Ancient Lords thereof.<note place="margin">Compare this with what was ſaid above <hi>ch.</hi> 6. §. 7.</note> And the Goths and Vandals being expelled; <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and the Emperours ſucceeding, reſtored the Lands unto the Heirs of thoſe who anciently poſſeſt it, notwithſtanding thoſe preſcriptions which in other caſes the Roman Laws did admit of againſt them. The very ſame was confirmed by a Law made by <hi>Honorius,</hi> who though <hi>Spain</hi> had been in the poſſeſſion of the Vandals for Three hundred Years,<note place="margin">Vand. l. <hi>1.</hi>

                     </note> as <hi>Procopius</hi> teſtifies; which Law we find alſo recited in the Council of <hi>Sivil,</hi> where this is added as the reaſon, <hi>Non enim erit objicienda praeſcriptio temporis, ubi neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas intereſt hoſtilitatis; For no preſcription of time is to be pleaded which is enforced by open hoſtility.</hi> Now look what Right they have to the Lands, the ſame alſo they have to every thing that is affixt to the ſoil; for even thoſe places, which had been formerly held as Sacred or Religious, being taken by Enemies if they do eſcape that calamity; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as if returned by a kind of Poſtliminy, ſhall be reſtored to their former condition, as <hi>Pomponius</hi> notes. Wherewith agrees that of <hi>Cicero</hi> concerning <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Segeſta,</hi> P.

                  <p>Concerning moveables the general rule is quite contrary; for they do not return by Poſtliminy, but are utterly loſt, as being lawful prize, and may therefore be bought and ſold; whereſoever they are found, they are adjudged his that bought them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the firſt owner any Right at all to them, though he find them either abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Neuters, or at home in his own Country. But from this general rule we find, that in Ancient times, ſuch things as were of uſe in War, were excepted; which ſeems to be agreed unto by the Nations for this reaſon, that the hopes of recovering ſuch things to themſelves, might render them the more cheerful and induſtrious in regaining them. For the Laws of moſt Cities in thoſe times were made for the encouragement of valour, and in favour to military affairs, wherefore their conſent was eaſily gained. What things were accounted uſeful in War we have already ſummed up out of <hi>Gallus Aelius,</hi> but we find them more accurately ſet down, as well by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Topicks, as by <hi>Modeſtinus:</hi> As, namely, Ships that are long and fit for burden, but not ſuch as are made for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Mules, but ſuch as are accuſtomed to the Pack-Saddle; Horſes and Mares, but ſuch as will abide the Bit, and are fit for ſervice: Armes alſo and Apparel are of neceſſary uſe in War, but theſe do not return by Poſtliminy; becauſe they were thought to merit no favour at all, who would ſuffer their Weapons and Garments to be taken from them: nay, it was accounted as a crime that deſerved puniſhment, as may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where appear in Hiſtories. And herein we may obſerve the difference they made between Horſes and Armes; the one being capable of reception, the other not; becauſe poſſible it was that an Horſe may break looſe of himſelf, and ſo fall within the Enemies power, without any default of his Rider, but ſo could not Arms. And this difference between moveables ſeems to have continued in uſe from the Goths until <hi>Boëtius</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who expounding <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Topicks, ſeems to ſpeak of this Right, as if it were in force at that Day.</p>

                  <p>But thoſe things, which though taken by the Enemy, yet were never within their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, have no need of Poſtliminy; becauſe by the Law of Nations, the owner never loſt his property in them: The like may be ſaid of ſuch things as are taken by Thieves and Pyrates; Becauſe (as <hi>

But ſurely this, as I ſaid elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">See ſecond Book, ch. 15. §. 5.</note>, was but a Relique of that barbarous Age, wherein the general corruption of mens manners had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away all ſenſe of that natural Society that ſhould be between all Mankind: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among Nations that had no publick War one againſt another, there was practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong private men a certain licence of War, which their different language and manners ſeemed to denounce; which licence, that it might not ſwell ſo high as to kill each other, it pleaſed the Nations to limit, and to agree, That they that were taken on either ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strangers, ſhould be held as Slaves; and conſequently they introduced the Law of Poſtliminy, which puts a difference between Strangers and Robbers or Pyrates; becauſe Strangers do uſually agree upon equal Conditions, which Pyrates and Robbers diſdain. It ſeems that of old it hath been a Caſe much controverted, Whether if the Subjects of a Confederate Nation, being Slaves here, ſhould eſcape from us and get home, They may be ſaid to return by Poſtliminy. This Queſtion we find propoſed by <hi>Cicero,</hi> concerning which <hi>Gallus Aelius</hi> delivers his opinion thus, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Orat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>obſerve the ſame Right of Poſtlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with a free people, with Confederates and with Kings, as we do with Enemies.</hi> But <hi>Proculus</hi>'s opinion was quite contrary, <hi>I doubt not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but that both our Confederates, and they that are a free Nation, are all Strangers unto us; between them and us there is no Poſtliminy.</hi> We are therefore to diſtinguiſh of Leagues; for if any Leagues be made on purpoſe only to put an end, or to prevent open War, thoſe Leagues do not for the time to come hinder either the taking of Priſoners, or the Right of Poſtliminy. But if in the Articles of the League it be expreſt, That the Subjects of either Nation may upon the publick Faith ſafely travel or ſojourn in the others Dominions, then it is not lawful to take Priſoners on either ſide, and ſo there is no place for Poſtliminy. And this I take to be the meaning of <hi>Pomponius,</hi> where he ſaith, If there be a Nation with whom we have neither friendſhip nor hoſpitality, nor League made for friendſhips ſake; theſe indeed are not enemies: But yet whatſoever of ours comes to them is theirs; and a man that is free with us, being taken by them, is made their Slave: and it is the ſame if any thing come from them to us, and therefore in this caſe Poſtliminy is granted. In mentioning a League made upon the account of friendſhip, he ſhews that there may be Leagues that have no Right either of friendſhip or hoſpitality. And <hi>Proculus</hi> ſufficiently declares, That by a people confederated, he underſtood ſuch a people as had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed friendſhip and ſafe hoſpitality, where he ſubjoined theſe words, For what need is there of Poſtliminy between us and them, when they may equally retain as well their own liberty as property in their own things with us, as they do among themſelves; and we may enjoy the ſame liberty and dominion with them as with our ſelves. Wherefore that which follows in <hi>Gallus Aelius,</hi> namely, With thoſe Nations that are under our juriſdiction, there is no Poſtliminy is to be underſtood with this ſupplement: nor with thoſe with whom we have contracted any League of friendſhip.</p>

                  <p>But in our days, not only amongſt Chriſtians, but even amongſt Mahometans, this Right of Captivity without the time of War, as alſo that of poſtliminy, are worn out of uſe. The neceſſity of both being taken away by virtue of that cognation or affinity wherein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath linked us, which is now re-acknowledged to be between all Mankind. Yet may that ancient Right of Nations be now in force, in caſe we have to do with any Nation ſo barbarous as to conceive it lawful for them to invade in an hoſtile manner the perſons and properties of all Strangers without any provocation or denouncing of War. And even whilſt I am writing this, thus it is adjudged in the High Court of <hi>Paris, Nicholaus Verduni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being Preſident, That the Goods which have been the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> but were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards taken by the Pyrates of <hi>Argier,</hi> who live upon the ſpoil of all that traffick by Sea, were by the Right of War juſtly alienated; and therefore being recovered by others, were theirs that recovered them. And in the ſame Court this alſo was adjudged, which I ſaid even now, That Ships are not to be at this day reckoned among the number of thoſe things that are received by Poſtliminy.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to look back, and to take away from thoſe that make War almoſt all thoſe Rights which I may be thought to have granted them, though indeed I have not. For when I began to explain this part of the Law of Nations, I alſo declared, That many things were ſaid to be right and lawful, becauſe they were not puniſhable by Law, partly becauſe they derive their authority from Military Councils, which notwithſtanding either ſwell beyond the Bounds of honeſty, whether we confine it to Right ſtrictly taken, or place it in the Precepts of other Vertues; or elſe they are ſuch as may more religiouſly, and amongſt good men, more commendably be left undone. <hi>Seneca</hi> brings in <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> pleading thus,

Thus alſo are Captains bound to make reſtitution for thoſe things that are either ſpoiled, or taken away by any under their Command; yea, and the whole Army in general, that ſhall run headlong to any one common outrage, as to fire a Town, or the like; and for particular acts, every particular Souldier ſhall ſatisfie for that loſs whereof he was the Authour, either ſolitary, or concurrent with others.</p>

But on the contrary, it cannot eaſily be granted that any man will raſhly give away his Right; and the nature of War is much different from that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. But to the end that Nations being once at peace, ſhould reſt ſo, and not involve themſelves in endleſs War againſt their will; it was thought ſufficient to introduce this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Right of Dominion,<note place="margin">See Book 2. Chap. 11.</note> whereof we have already ſpoken, which notwithſtanding may very well conſiſt with that internal obligation to reſtitution.

                  <p>But when we may juſtly kill our Enemies in a juſt War, according to that which we call internal juſtice, and when we may not, may eaſily be underſtood by what we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid in the firſt Chapter of this Book. One man may be ſaid to kill another, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally or purpoſely; no man may juſtly be killed purpoſely, unleſs it be for ſome crime that deſerves Death, or becauſe we cannot otherwiſe defend our own lives or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: And although to take away the life of a man, for things of ſmall value, do not ſwerve from the rules of juſtice ſtrictly taken; yet it doth from the rules of Charity. Now that the puniſhment may be juſt, it is neceſſary that he that is killed ſhould offend, and that in ſo high a meaſure, as that by the ſentence of an upright Judge, he may be condemned to Death; whereof we ſhall now ſpeak the leſs, becauſe we have already ſufficiently done it in the Chapter of <hi>Puniſhments.</hi>

                  <p>Heretofore when we treated of Suppliants (for ſuch there are as well in War as Peace) we diſtinguiſht between misfortune and injuſtice. <hi>Gylippus</hi> the Lacedemonian, diſcourſing about the Right of Suppliants, ſtates the Caſe thus; they who at the firſt introduced that Right, did certainly intend mercy and compaſſion to thoſe whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had made miſerable; but as to ſuch as were fallen into miſery, through their own deceitful dealings, or out of a deſire to uſurp another mans Right, theſe have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to blame fortune, nor ought to aſſume unto themſelves the name of Suppliants. Whence we may obſerve, That whereas there are two ſorts of men, that uſually cry for protection, they that are unfortunate, and they that are malefactors: <hi>Gylippus</hi> places the Athenians amongſt theſe latter, becauſe unprovoked by any injury, they made War upon the Syracuſians; whereupon he infers, that ſince they voluntarily began the War, it was but juſt that they ſhould feel the evil conſequences that attended the War. Examples of ſuch as are unfortunately miſerable, are thoſe who being no Enemies, are notwithſtanding unhapily found, and thereby blocked up amongſt Enemies, although they bear no malice againſt us: Such were the Athenians, when <hi>Ariſtion</hi> their Tyrant forced them to ſide with <hi>Mithridates</hi> againſt the Romans; of whom <hi>Paterculus</hi> writes thus,<note place="margin">

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs being miſerably oppreſt by the forces of</hi> Mithridates <hi>within, who held their City in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiet of them, and ſtraitly beſieged by the Romans, their friends without, whilst their hearts were without their walls,</hi>

                     <hi>they were compelled to keep their bodies within.</hi> The latter part of which ſentence ſeems to have been borrowed from <hi>Livy,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Indibilis,</hi> ſaith, That with his Body he ſerved the Carthaginians, but with his mind the Romans.

                  <p>This alſo is to be obſerved, That between a plain and manifeſt injury, and an injury done by a mere miſchance, there intercedes ſometimes ſomething of a middle nature, as if participating ſomewhat of either; ſo as the action is neither merely or altogether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, nor yet done merely through ignorance or againſt our will. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls theſe acts <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>and without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now whereas in humane Society injuries may be done three ſeveral ways; thoſe done merely through ignorance are called miſchances, as when a miſchief lights upon a man againſt whom no hurt was ever intended, (as for example, if a Son by forcing open a Door ſhould acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally wound his own Father, whom he could not ſuſpect to be behind;) or if a greater hurt or damage befal a man than what was intended, (as if a Fencer, for the tryal of skill, and only intending to draw bloud, ſhould kill his Adverſary,) it might be called a miſchance, but not a miſchief. For whatſoever happens beſides what a man propoſeth to himſelf, is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to misfortune: for haply</hi> vellicare voluit non vulnerare, <hi>He intended to beat him, not to wound him; or if he did intend to wound, yet haply not this man, but another; or it may be not in that manner, or in ſo great a meaſure, as it fell out: if therefore any ſuch hurt or damage do ariſe, beſides what was intended, or might probably be expected, it ſhall be eſteemed as a miſchance, not a miſchief. But ſecondly, If the wrong done might have been foreſeen and prevented, though it were not done</hi> improbo animo, <hi>with a wicked intention, it ſhall be accounted as a fault</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

But when a man doth what he doth knowingly, though not deliberately, it is confeſt that an injury is done; as he that in a Foreſt ſhoots at a Deer, but kills a man whom he ſaw not, is unfortunate: but he that diſcharges a Muſquet in a populous Street, though with no miſchievous intention, yet if he kill a man, he ſins; becauſe he did it freely and voluntarily (though not conſiderately:) As alſo they that through anger, or any other perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, either natural or neceſſary, ſhall hurt a man, cannot be faultleſs; and yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account them wicked or malicious. But yet if a man ſhould knowingly and premeditatedly do the ſame thing, he may juſtly be accounted wicked.

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49430:196"/> after the occaſion, namely, Who gave it, and how great the provocation was. For anger uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſeth from hence, when a man thinks himſelf to be injured; and therefore in ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as do ariſe about wrongs done through anger, the Queſtion is not as in ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi> An hoc factum ſit, <hi>Whether done or not; for therein, unleſs excuſed by forgetfulneſs, one of the Parties muſt of neceſſity be unjuſt; as namely, He that fulfils not the Contract.

For he that firſt gave the occaſion, did it knowingly; it is no marvel then if the one Party may think himſelf to be injured; and the other not, it may notwithſtanding ſo happen, That he that through anger doth the wrong may be unjuſt; if, namely, the revenge ſwell higher than the provocation; or the wrong we do, bear not a juſt proportion with what we before ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For</hi> juſtus eſt qui deliberatò juſtè agit, <hi>He is a juſt man who knowingly and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth juſtly; for poſſible it is that a man may do juſtly knowingly, but not deliberately.

This having now got the victory, I am willing to forget,</hi> Quia viri fortis eſt, qui de victoria contendant eos for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes putare; qui victi ſunt, eos homines judicare, ut poſſit Bellum fortitudo minuere, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem humanitatis augere: <hi>Becauſe it is the part of a valiant Commander, to eſteem men as Enemies whilſt they are able to contend for victory; but being overcome, then to pity them as men; that ſo valour may end the War, and humanity confirm the Peace. But you will haply ſay, what if he had overcome you, would he have done ſo? wherefore then ſhould you ſpare him? I anſwer,</hi> Quia talem ſtultitiam contemnere, non imitari conſuevi; <hi>Becauſe it is my cuſtome to contemn, and not to imitate ſuch folly.</hi> Now if this Author did mean this of the Romans (which is very uncertain, becauſe he intermixes many ſtrange, and indeed Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick ſtories, with ſome true ones) it manifeſtly contradicts that which we read in the Panegyrick of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantius, He acts the part of a prudent man, who having conquered Rebels can bind them to himſelf by a free pardon; but he, of a valiant man, who having vext them, can trample upon them. Thou haſt revived, O Emperour, that ancient confidence of the Roman Empire, who triumphed in the death of thoſe great Commanders whom they had taken in the War; for in thoſe days their Captive Kings, after they had graced their triumphs, by attending the Conquerours Chariot from the Ports to the moſt publick place of the City, as ſoon as he turned his Chariot towards the Capitol, were hurried away to Execution. Only</hi> Perſeus <hi>upon the interceſſion of</hi> Paulus Aemilius, <hi>to whom he had yielded himſelf, eſcaped the ſeverity of this cuſtome; but the reſt having their eyes put out, remained for ever after in Chains: teaching thereby other Kings rather to preſerve their faith and friendſhip with the people of Rome, than to exaſperate their juſtice.</hi> But theſe things are written ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too looſely. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Hiſtory concerning the death of <hi>Simon Bar-jorae,</hi> teſtifies the ſame ſeverity of the Romans; but he ſpeaks it of ſuch Captains and Commanders only as was <hi>Pontius Samnis,</hi> but not of ſuch as carried the titles of Kings, whoſe words ſound thus, <hi>The concluſion of the triumph was after that the triumphant Chariot was come to the Capitol; for there by the Ancient cuſtome the Conquerour was to ſtay till tidings were brought of the death of that great Commander, whom he led in triumph; who having an halter caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, was preſently drawn into the Market-place, his Keepers whipping him forward: for in that place by the cuſtome of the Romans, ſuch as were condemned for Capital crimes, were put to death, and there executed. So ſoon then as it was declared unto the Emperour, that his Enemy was dead, they immediately proceeded to perform all other the Rites that were in thoſe caſes provided very joyfully.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Orat. in Ver.</note> The very ſame ceremonies doth <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo recite in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning Puniſhments.

                     <hi>Eutropius</hi> likewiſe records it of <hi>Maximianus Herculius,</hi> that having ſlain the Francks and Almains, and taken their Kings Captives, <hi>He expoſed them to be devoured by wild Beaſts.</hi> So doth <hi>Ammianus</hi> concerning a King of the Almains, who being taken Captive was crucified. Yet even among the Romans there were divers Kings beſides <hi>Perſeus,</hi> that eſcaped the ſeverity of that cuſtome, as <hi>Syphax, Gentius, Juba,</hi> and in the time of the <hi>Caeſars, Caractius,</hi> and others: Whence it may appear that the Romans (though as <hi>Cicero</hi> and others blame them for being too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in this caſe) had always ſome reſpect both to the cauſes of the War, and alſo to the manner of its proſecution, when they thus puniſh'd them: And therefore it was no ill advice that <hi>M. Aemilius Paulus</hi> gave to the Roman Senate in the caſe of <hi>Perſeus, Si nihil humani metuerent, at divinam vindictam timerent iis imminentem qui victoriâ inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius utuntur; Though they ſtood not in awe of any humane power, yet they ſhould do well to fear the anger of the Gods, who never failed to avenge themſelves on thoſe who abuſed their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, with too much pride and inſolency. Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Agis</hi> obſerves, that in the Grecian Wars ſuch reverence was born unto the office and dignity of a King, that their very Enemies durſt not offer violence to the Lacedemonian Kings. An Enemy therefore that conſidereth not what humane Laws permit to be done, but what in equity he
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49430:198"/> ought to do, or what Religion and Piety requires to be done, forbears the ſhedding of the blood even of his Enemies; neither will he ſentence any man to death, unleſs it be to preſerve life or livelyhood to himſelf, or for ſuch perſonal crimes as by the Laws of God or Man deſerve death; yea, and though ſome of them do deſerve it, yet in conſideration of humane frailty, and of the inſtability of fortune or ſome ſuch probable reaſons, he either altogether omits, or at leaſt contents himſelf with ſuch a puniſhment as is not capital. It is an excellent obſervation that <hi>Diodorus</hi> makes, <hi>That whoſoever ſucceeds proſperouſly in War, whether it were the expugnation of Cities or victory in Battel,</hi> Saepe fortunae magis quam virtuti debentur; <hi>are for the moſt part rather the gift of fortune, than the neceſſary effect of true valour.</hi> But to ſhew mercy unto ſuch as they have conquered, is the work of Providence only. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Curtius, Though he was highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt the Authors of the War, yet he thought it prudent to forgive them all.</hi>

                  <p>Againſt theſe Rules of natural Right and Equity, are uſually brought theſe ſpecious Exceptions, which notwithſtanding have little of ſolidity in them: as namely, What if ſuch acts of cruelty be done by way of retaliation? what if they be done by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to deter others? or what if it be done againſt ſuch as have been notoriouſly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? None of theſe are ſufficient to juſtifie an unneceſſary or an unjuſt Slaughter, as is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be collected by what we have already written concerning the juſt cauſes of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Enemies. For from Captives and ſuch as actually deliver themſelves or deſire ſo to do, there can be no danger. That therefore they may juſtly be put to death, there ought to precede ſome ſuch crime, as to an impartial Judge ſhould deſerve death. And thus we may haply read of cruelty ſometimes uſed unto ſuch as have either been taken Priſoners, or yielded without Conditions of life, if being convicted of the injuſtice of the War, they have ſtill perſiſted in Armes, or if they have reproached or defamed the Conquerour with bitter invectives, or have broken their faith, or ſomewhat of the Law of Nations, as the priviledges of Ambaſſadours, or have been Traitors, Renegadoes, or the like. But as to the Objection of retaliation, Nature doth not admit thereof, unleſs it be againſt thoſe numerical perſons, who have done the wrong. Neither will it ſuffice to ſay, That the Enemies do all of them make but one Body by their combination againſt us, as may eaſily be gathered by what hath been already ſaid, when we treated concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of puniſhments. For, as we read in <hi>Aristides, Is it not a ſhame to imitate that as juſt, which we condemn in others as unjuſt.</hi> Upon which account it was that <hi>Plutarch</hi> blames the Syracuſians for putting to death the Wives of <hi>Hicetas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut.

But as to the profit which may hereafter be expected by putting a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into others,<note place="margin">Terror.</note> this gives no poſitive Right to put any man to death that yields himſelf Priſoner. But if there be juſt cauſe of death before given, this may be one cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others why the puniſhment due may not be remitted. Again, an obſtinate endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to maintain our own Party, if our cauſe be not altogether unjuſt or diſhoneſt, doth not at all deſerve puniſhment,<note place="margin">Goth. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> as the Neapolitans argue in <hi>Procopius;</hi> or if it do, ſurely that puniſhment cannot amount to death, if equity may be the Judge.

                  <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it may eaſily be gathered what the Law of Nature doth determine concerning Hoſtages. In Ancient times when it was generally believed, that every man had as much right over his own life, as he had in any other thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he claimed a propriety; and that this right, was either by explicite or implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent transferred into that Commonwealth or City wherein he lived, it was not to be wondred at; if, as we may read, thoſe hoſtages, though in themſelves innocent, were ſometimes put to death for the offences of thoſe Cities whereunto they belonged, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were delivered by their own peculiar conſent, or by the publick, wherein theirs alſo was included: But ſince a purer light hath diſcovered unto us, that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power over mens lives is reſerved in God alone; it follows, that no man can by his own conſent only, give unto another this power, either over his own life, or over the life of his fellow Citizen. Wherefore that noble Captain <hi>Narſes</hi> (as <hi>Agathias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates) did abominate it as an act of cruelty, to put to death ſuch hoſtages, as were no
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:49430:201"/> ways guilty of thoſe crimes that were committed againſt him. So alſo have others done in like caſes, even by the example of <hi>Scipio</hi> (perhaps) who was wont to ſay, <hi>That he ſcorned to take revenge on the innocent hoſtages, but he would ſeverely puniſh the Delinquents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Nec ab inermi ſed ab armato hoſte poenas expetiturum; <hi>Diſdaining</hi> (it ſeems) <hi>that revenge that was taken upon an unarmed foe.</hi> The very ſame anſwer do we read of, given upon the like occaſion by the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> as <hi>Eunapius</hi> teſtifies. That which our modern Lawyers, and thoſe no mean ones hold forth, namely, That ſuch conventions and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are valid, in caſe they are confirmed by ordinary and general practice; I alſo condeſcend unto, in caſe they will underſtand by right, that which is not puniſhable; for ſo, in this argument it is uſually taken: but in caſe they imagine, that they that ſhall take away the life of any, by vertue of ſuch a pact or agreement only, do not ſin, I fear that they are both deceived themſelves, and by their perilous examples deceive others. But plainly, if he that comes as an hoſtage be at that time, or at any time before hath been a notorious offender, or hath afterwards in any matters of moment ſatisfied his faith given in any of theſe caſes, his puniſhment may be without injury. But the flight of <hi>Clelia</hi> over <hi>Tiber,</hi> when ſhe made her eſcape to King <hi>Ethruſeus,</hi> was not only ſafe, but to uſe <hi>Livys</hi> own words, an honourable attempt; becauſe ſhe came as an hoſtage, not by any voluntary act or conſent of her own, but by the command of the City ſhe was ſent from.</p>

                  <p>And this in the firſt place happens, when that part of the Country which yields profit is ſo in our poſſeſſion, that the Enemy can reap no benefit by it.

Poſſible it is, that they that are now moſt bitterly enraged againſt us, may upon debate and conference had, become our Friends and Allies. And then we will eaſily confeſs, That</hi> Amicos neceſſariis fraudare, durum eſt; <hi>To defraud our Friends of neceſſaries, is very hard. It is very true what from our Anceſtors we have received, We ought ſo to truſt our friends, as if at ſome times or other they may be our Enemies; that is, that every man ought to reſerve ſomething within his own breaſt of what near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concerns himſelf, whereby to provide for his own ſafety; and not ſo wholly to diſcover himſelf by his words or actions, as that he may one day repent himſelf by reaſon of the vehemency of either paſſion, and blame his own raſhneſs when it is too late to help it. This in all Cities is obſerved as an Oracle, That in times of Peace they ever provide for War; and in times of War they lay the foundations of a firm and laſting Peace: we ſhould neither place too much confidence in our friends, becauſe they may prove our enemies; neither ſhould we appear too diffident of our enemies, becauſe they may hereafter prove our friends. But if the hopes of our enemies converſion cannot prevail with us to do them civil offices, yet let us remember, That there is no hoſtility at all againſt us in thoſe things which an enemies Country produceth. For all things there are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, all things profitable, all things pleaſureable, or very neceſſary to our ſelves. All its fruits affording unto us, either nouriſhment, or ſomewhat that is equivalent unto it. Again,</hi> Non opportet Bellum inferre Belli neſciis; <hi>We ought not to make War upon thoſe things that are ſo amicable, ſo innocent, that they know not what War means. To burn, cut down, and utterly to extirpate thoſe things which Nature by heat from above and moiſture from beneath, hath ſo tenderly brought up and nouriſhed, to no other end but to pay their yearly Tribute unto men, as unto Kings, ſavours of too much inhumanity.</hi> Thus far <hi>Philo;</hi> wherewith agrees that of <hi>Joſephus, If Trees,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>could ſpeak, they would certainly upbraid us with injuſtice, for inflicting upon them the plagues and miſeries of War, who are in no wiſe guilty of the cauſes thereof.</hi> Neither hath that Saying of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> any other ground than this, where he tells us, <hi>That to cut down or to hurt tender Plants or Trees that bear Fruit, is a ſin againſt Nature, and not juſtifiable before God.</hi>

There is a moſt excellent Epiſtle upon this Argument extant in <hi>Procopius,</hi> which <hi>Beliſarius</hi> writes to <hi>Totilas, It hath been,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>reputed in former Ages the Glory of wiſe men to raiſe fair and magnificent Structures, to preſerve their Names and Memories; but to raſe and demoliſh them being built was ever eſteemed the badge of folly and madneſs, as not bluſhing to tranſmit to Poſterity the Monuments of their own vileneſs. It is confeſt by all men, That</hi> Rome <hi>is the moſt magnificent and beautiful City of all that the Sun beholds: Neither did it ariſe to this height of ſplendour by the bounty or induſtry of any one man, or in few years; but many Kings and Emperours, and a vaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or ſucceſſion of Noble-men, many Ages, and a ſtupendious Maſs of Treaſure, have drawn hither, as other things, ſo the moſt expert Artificers in the World, whereby having by little and little brought this City to that perfection, wherein we now ſee it, they have bequeathed it to future Ages, as an everlaſting Monument of their Vertue and Magnanimity; wherefore to raſe this City, were to be injurious to Mankind in all Ages; to our Ancestors, in ſacrilegiouſly burying in its Ruines the memory of their noble Acts; to our Poſterity, enviouſly depriving them of the very ſight of thoſe noble Structures, whereby they may be excited to the imitation of their Vertues. And if it be thus, then conſider that one of theſe two muſt neceſſarily fall out, either the Emperour muſt vanquiſh, or you: If you be Conquerour, then in deſtroying this City you deſtroy not what is your Enemies, but your own; and in preſerving it, you enjoy the richeſt and moſt beautiful place
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:49430:202"/> on the Earth. But in caſe thou be worſted, thy clemency in preſerving this great City ſhall plead ſtrongly to the Emperour for mercy; but in deſtroying it, all hopes of favour lye buried in the ruines of it: and thou ſhalt not only loſe whatever thou canſt gain by the Spoil, but an eternal brand of ſhame and infamy ſhall cleave unto thy Name throughout all Ages, according to thy dealings herein.

                  <p>Thirdly, We ought to forbear the waſting of an Enemies Country, if we ſee that they may be otherwiſe ſupplied with neceſſaries, either by Sea or Land. <hi>Archidamus</hi> in <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,</hi> in that Oration wherein he diſſwades the Lacedemonians from making War againſt <hi>Athens,</hi> enquires what hopes they had to ſubdue the Athenians; If by waſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their Country, they might do well to remember, That the Athenians had other Lands and Countries under their Dominion, which confined not on their Cities (as <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Ionia</hi>) and that they wanted neither Ships nor Ports, whereby they might be ſupplied with neceſſaries from any other Coaſts. In which Caſe it was beſt to cheriſh and protect the Husbandman, even to the Enemies Quarters; that upon payment of their Contributions to either Party, they might enjoy Peace in the midſt of War: which we have ſeen done, not only in our own late Civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> but (not long ſince) in the Wars of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi> which alſo is very agreeable to the practice of the Indians, among whom, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> writes, <hi>Their Husbandmen enjoy the very ſame Priviledges and Immunities, as do their Prieſts; inſomuch that they follow the Plough without danger, even in the midſt of their Troops, and to the very Skirts of their Camp.</hi> And a little after he adds, <hi>There is no enemy that will willingly wrong Husbandmen, but will rather preſerve them from all injuries, as being the common Benefactors to both Parties.</hi> Wherefore it was agreed and concluded in the War
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:49430:203"/> between <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the Aſſyrian, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> records it, That, <hi>Cum agricolis pax eſſet, cum armatis bellum; Though the ſouldiers might fight, yet the Husbandmen ſhould live in peace.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the Indians, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> teſtifies, either burn their Enemies Corn, or cut down their Trees. <hi>Polyaenus</hi> reports the ſame of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> namely, that he ſet the fruitfulleſt part of the Country to Farmers and Husbandmen;<note place="margin">

And this we have ſeen in our days to be practiſed by the Hollanders, who ordinarily ſold their Corn and other proviſions even to their Enemies, and with the money ſo raiſed paid their own Army, with as much equity as profit, even to the admiration of foreign Nations. Theſe manners and cuſtoms do our Canons commend to our Chriſtian imitation; becauſe as we profeſs to be more civilized, ſo ought we to expreſs more humanity in our Wars, than was practiſed among the Heathens; whereof they enjoin us not to ſpare not the husbandmen only, but the Oxen and Horſes wherewith they plow, and the ſeed which they carry out to ſow their ground.

Which Right of Nations we conceive to be of another kind than that which conſiſts either in a bare impunity, or by virtue of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgments.

                  <p>But if the Debt wherein a Foreign Prince ſtands obliged unto us be penal only, I do not perceive that by the conſent of Nations ſuch a Right is given to detain his Subjects Goods barely for his neglect. For ſuch a tye upon another mans Goods would be odious, and therefore ſhould not extend it ſelf farther than the perſon offending. Neither is there the like profit ariſing from theſe latter Debts, as from the former; for the former Debts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome reparation for the loſs of Goods, but ſo do not theſe latter: and therefore the proſecution of them may without damage be omitted.

For there men ſtood obliged, not for that properly, becauſe the City might have been puniſhed; but only to compel the City to do what it ought to do, that is, to inflict puniſhments upon Offenders; the neglect whereof is referred to the former, and not unto theſe latter ſort of Debts. For to owe a Duty in puniſhing Offenders is one thing, and to lye obnoxious to puniſhment for the non-performance of that Duty is another. The omiſſion of that doth uſually induce this, yet ſo that the former is the cauſe and the latter the effect. And therefore the Goods of an Enemies Subjects cannot lawfully be poſſeſt by way of puniſhment. For this were to puniſh the innocent for the nocent; but ſuch things only are liable to this Debt, that belong to the perſons who are Delinquents, amongſt whom are the Magiſtrates themſelves, whoſe Duty it was to puniſh, but did it not.</p>

                  <head>I. How far forth men may be enſlaved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Juſtice.</head>
                  <p>IN ſuch places where this Right is yet in force, of taking men Priſoners, and making them Slaves, if we reſpect internal Juſtice, it is to be reſtrained in the ſame manner as the Right of taking things is; that is to ſay, It is ſo far lawful, until we are ſatisfied our original Debt, together with the ſubſequent Charges thereof, unleſs the perſons ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhall be found guilty of ſuch particular crimes as in common equity deſerve to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the loſs of liberty. Hitherto therefore, but no farther, hath he that wageth a juſt War a Right in the Captives taken from his Enemy, and a power to transfer that Right firmly unto others. But here alſo the ſame equity and humanity ſhould perſwade us to put the like difference as before we obſerved, when we diſcourſed concerning the killing of our enemies. <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> in that Oration which he wrote concerning <hi>Licurgus</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, extols the clemency of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for that he made not all that were found amongſt his Enemies, Slaves; <hi>but weighing, as in a juſt Ballance, all circumstances, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather as a Judge than as a Conquerour.</hi> Thus likewiſe did <hi>Alexander</hi> his Son,<note place="margin">Plut. vit. Alex.</note> who having taken <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſet at liberty both their Prieſts, and ſuch of their Citizens as had not aſſented to the Decree that the City paſt againſt him.</p>

                  <head>II. What may be juſtly done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captives in equity.</head>
                  <p>But here it is in the firſt place to be obſerved, That this Right of making men Slaves, which ariſeth as by Suretiſhip for that City, whereof they were Members, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf ſo far as that which ariſeth directly from perſonal delinquency, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made Slaves by way of juſt puniſhment. And therefore a reſolute Spartan being commanded to do ſome ſlaviſh Office, pleaded, That <hi>he was indeed a Captive, but no Slave.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Captivum ſe, non Servum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebat.</note> 
                     <hi>Philo</hi> obſerves, <hi>That ſometimes Parents are taken and made Slaves for their Childrens faults, and ſometimes Children for their Parents crimes; as when they are taken either by Pirates or in the Wars, whom notwithſtanding the Law of Nature, much more vigorous than any humane Law, ſets free.</hi> And indeed, if we look directly into that general Right which a juſt War gives over Captives, it is much like unto that which a Lord hath over ſuch Servants, as being reduced to poverty have ſold themſelves unto him; only herein lyes the difference, That the condition of thoſe taken in War is the more to be pitied, becauſe this calamity befel them, not through any crime which was <hi>properly</hi> their own; but through the default of their Governours. <hi>To be made a Slave by the Right of War, is</hi> (as <hi>Iſocrates</hi> accounts it) <hi>a bitter thing.</hi> For this kind of bondage is a perpetual Obligation to all kinds of labour and hardſhip, for a perpetual ſupply of Food and Rayment. <hi>Chryſippus</hi>'s definition doth very well agree with ſuch kind of Slaves, who ſaith, That a Slave is a perpetual Hireling. And thus doth the Moſaick Law eſteem of him whom poverty hath compelled to ſell his liberty, as we read <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.18, 40, 53. And his Redemption ſhall be paid by his work, as the Fruits of Lands ſold or mortgaged, ſhall redeem it to them that ſold it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.50. There is therefore a main difference between that which by the Law of Nations may be done unto a Slave without puniſhment, and that which natural reaſon and equity doth allow to be done unto him. So ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the place before cited,<note place="margin">De Clem. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>

                  <p>Thus alſo <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaking of Servants ſaith, <hi>That by treating them liberally, as by enlarging their proportion in dyet and cloathing, by remitting ſomewhat of their hard labour, or by granting them ſome little ſtock of their own to be kept with thoſe of their Maſters, they may be made more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, careful and induſtrious than they would be.</hi> Neither will it be much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſay,<note place="margin">Peculium.</note> That ſuch a little ſtock may at the will of the Lord be either taken away or diminiſhed at pleaſure: For in caſe he doth ſo without juſt cauſe, he deals very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly with them. But a juſt cauſe there may be, not only when it is done by way of puniſhment, but when it is done to ſupply the neceſſity of his Lord; for the Servants profits are more ſubject to the neceſſities of his Lord, than the goods of Citizens to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they inhabit.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> de Ben.</note> Very pertinent hereunto is that of <hi>Seneca, It will not follow that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath nothing, becauſe his Lord may chuſe whether he ſhall have any thing.</hi> And again in the ſame place, <hi>Who can doubt but that the Servant, together with his ſtock, is the Lords; yet may the Servant preſent his Lord with a gift.</hi> And hence it is that the Lord cannot re-demand that debt which being due unto his Servant in the time of his ſervitude, he pays him after his manumiſſion. For as <hi>Trophoninus</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Debiti, vel non debiti ratio, in condidictione naturaliter intelligitur; In perſonal actions, the conſideration of what is due or not due is to be underſtood naturally.</hi> But poſſible it is, That the Lord may be indebted to his Slave naturally: As therefore Clients may confer ſomething to the uſe of Patrons, and Subjects to the uſe of Kings; ſo we may read of ſome Servants who have out of their own ſmall ſtock contributed ſomething to the uſe of their Lords:<note place="margin">Dionyſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Lib. <hi>8.</hi> Ep. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> As in caſe he be to raiſe a Portion for the marrying of his Daughter, or to redeem a Son out of Captivity, or upon ſuch like accidents. <hi>Pliny</hi> indulged this favour to his Slaves, That they might make their Wills, and give or bequeath what they had got unto any, ſo they were of his own Family. Among ſome Nations we read, That a fuller right of acquiring things was granted unto them according to the ſeveral degrees of ſervitude; as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where deſcribed.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> And many nations have corrected their Laws, reducing their external right of Lords over their Servants unto that internal juſtice, which we have heretofore expounded: For even among the Grecians it was lawful for Slaves, being too rigorouſly treated, to demand, That they might be ſold. And even at <hi>Rome</hi> they might <hi>ad Statuas confugere; Fly to the Statues,</hi> or implore the aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrates in caſes of Famine, Cruelty, or any ſuch unſufferable injuries done them. And this alſo is now allowed, though not in the ſtrictneſs of right, yet as proceeding from the goodneſs and humanity, and ſometimes ſuch as may be in equity due; as, That after long and very hard ſervice, they have rewarded that ſervice with liberty. So ſaith <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian,</hi> After that Captivity by the Law of Nations came to be in force, manumiſſion became a courteſie. An example whereof <hi>Terence</hi> gives us:

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:49430:207"/> That Servants, though not of the beſt, yet at leaſt not of the worſt kinds of ſervitude, were rewarded with liberty. And as he adds, <hi>Were permitted to carry away with them whatſoever they had got in the time of their ſervice.</hi> Whereof we have many examples yet extant in our Martyrologies.

Which Queſtion in regard of the perſons ſo taken in War, cannot be well omitted. For if their Parents did for their own crimes deſerve to be put to death; Children that were expected to be born of them are bound to ſerve for giving them their lives, which otherwiſe they had never had. For otherwiſe alſo even for want of Food and Rayment their Parents had power to have ſold them for Slaves, as we have elſewhere ſhewed. Such a Right it was that God himſelf gave unto the Hebrews,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> over the Children of the Cannanites. So for the publick Debts of a City, Children already born,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.13.</note> as being a part of that City, may ſtand no leſs obliged than their Parents. But for thoſe that are unborn, this reaſon ſufficeth not, but ſome others are requiſite: As the expreſs conſent of Parents, together with the neceſſity of nouriſhing them, and that even for ever; or for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them aliment, and that ſo long only until their labour ſhall fully ſatisfie the charge of their maintenance. If any Right beyond this be given to a Lord over ſuch Children, it proceeds from the too great indulgence of the Civil Law to the Lords themſelves.</p>

                  <head>I. How far Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may be gained by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal juſtice.</head>
                  <p>WHAT in equity is requiſite, or in humanity commendable, being done to ſingle perſons, is ſo much more being done to a Nation or any parts of it; by how much the good or evil that is done to a multitude, is more notorious than the ſame done to particular men. Surely by a juſt War, as other things, ſo alſo the Right of ſoveraignty over the people, and the very Right that the people have in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be lawfully acquired; that is to ſay, ſo far as the greatneſs either of the puniſhment due to their crime, or of ſome other debt doth warrant it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we may add ſo far as is neceſſary to ſecure the Conquerour from ſome great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger that otherwiſe may befall him. But this Cauſe is for the moſt part mixed with others, which notwithſtanding as well in making of peace, as in proſecuting the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is principally aimed at. For in the other caſes that the Conquerour remits the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or debt, it is from his mercy. But that ſecurity which in publick dangers exceeds moderation is cruelty. Thus doth <hi>Iſocrates</hi> adviſe <hi>Philip, It will ſuffice thee ſo far to ſubdue the Barbarians, that thou mayeſt ſecure the Peace of thine own Country.</hi>

                  <p>That which <hi>Salust</hi> records of the Ancient Romans is worthy of our imitation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were ſo Religious, <hi>That they they took nothing away from the conquered, but the licence they took to do them wrong.</hi> And in another place he tells us, <hi>That wiſe men make War for Peace ſake, and ſustain labour in hopes of rest;</hi> Sapientes pacis cauſa Bellum gerunt,<note place="margin">Jugurth.

Not much diſcrepant is that of <hi>Ariſtotle, The end of War is Peace, as the End of Motion is rest.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that notable ſaying of <hi>Cicero, Bellum ita ſuſcipiatur, ut nihil aliud niſi Pax quaeſita videatur; War ſhould be ſo made, as if nothing elſe were thereby intended but Peace.</hi> And in another place, <hi>War ſhould be undertaken for this cauſe only, that we may live in Peace and not be injured.</hi> Nor is this much different from what our Chriſtian Divines teach us, <hi>The end,</hi> ſay they, <hi>of War is to remove thoſe things that diſturb Peace.</hi> Before <hi>Ninus</hi> his Raign, Kings were ſtudious to preſerve the bounds of their own Empires, but not to enlarge them. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the Perſian, <hi>Manendum cuique intra fines ſuos nihil novan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; Every King ought to confine himſelf within his own Dominions, and not encroach upon anothers; neither ſhould any man, out of an uncertain hope invade the right of another, but reſt contented with his own.</hi> All Kingdoms were at firſt limited with their own bounds, neither were Kings ſo Ambitious of Empire to themſelves, as of glory to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and if they did make War it was not for Dominion, but for the honour of the Conqueſt. Now unto this Ancient Cuſtome it is, that St. <hi>Aug.</hi> laboured as much as in him lay to reduce us,<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">De Clem. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> And this is it that <hi>Seneca</hi> highly commends in a Conquerour, <hi>Nihil ex rege victo praeter gloriam ſumere; To take nothing from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered beſides the honour of the Conqueſt. This is triumph over Victory it ſelf; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that there was nothing to be found among the Conquered worthy of the Conquerours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, but the Conquest it ſelf.</hi> Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> having overcome <hi>Tigranes,</hi> left him a part of his Kingdom to govern, as <hi>Eutropius</hi> informs us.

                  <p>But in caſe it be not thought ſafe for the Conquerour to leave the Conquered altogether free, yet may the matter be ſo moderated, that ſome part of the Government may be left to them, or their King, with a reſervation of ſome other part to the Conquerour. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> tells us, That it was the manner of the Romans to make uſe of Kings themſelves as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſubjection. <hi>Antiochus</hi> is ſaid to be, <hi>Romanis inſervientium Regum ditiſſimus, The richeſt of all the Kings that were ſubject to the Romans.</hi> The like we read in the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon <hi>Muſonius,</hi> namely, Of ſome Kings that were ſubject to the Romans.

                     <hi>that were ſubject to the Great Kings:</hi> As there are now alſo among the Turks. Now as concerning the manner how an Empire may be mixt, we have already treated; but ſometimes a part of a Kingdom being taken away, the reſt is left to the Conquered, as is uſual after the Conqueſt to take away ſome part of the Fields, and to leave another part to the ancient Occupants.</p>

                  <p>Another favour may alſo without danger be granted to the vanquiſhed, namely, The free exerciſe of their Religion, and not at all to withdraw them from it; unleſs it may be done by perſwaſion: which, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his Oration to the Emperour <hi>Caius</hi> proves, is both grateful to the Conquered, and no ways prejudicial to the Conquerour. And this was it that, as well <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf as, the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> objected againſt the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jews at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> That through the Indulgence of the Romans they might exerciſe their own Religion with ſo great a right and freedom, that they might drive Strangers out of their Temple, even with the peril of their lives. But in caſe the Religion of the Conquered be falſe, yet may the Conquerour make it his care that the true Religion be not oppreſſed. As the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did, by weakening <hi>Licinius</hi>'s Party; and as the Francks and other Kings did after him. And although we cannot perſwade them to the worſhip of the true God, yet muſt we not drive them from the worſhip of their own. For, to uſe the words of <hi>Severus, Melius eſt ibi aliquem coli Deum, quàm nullum; Better it is that any God be there worſhipped, than none at all.</hi> Thus the Goths in <hi>Procopius</hi> profeſs, That they would not compel any man to embrace their Religion, but leave them to their own.</p>

                  <p>The laſt Premonition is this, That where the Empire is fully and abſolutely got, the Vanquiſhed ſhould be treated with much kindneſs and clemency, and ſo as may ſtand with the mutual good both of the Conquerour and Conquered. <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> bids the Aſſyrians, whom he had overcome, to be of good cheer, for their condition ſhould be the ſame as before; for they ſhould only change their King, but their Houſes, Fields, Wives, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould as fully remain theirs, as they were before.

                  <p>HOW far forth in a Juſt War things taken away may be his that takes them, hath been already declared; from which are to be deducted ſuch things as are received by the Right of Poſtliminy: for theſe are as if they had not been taken. But the things taken in an unjuſt War (as we have ſaid before) are to be reſtored, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe that took them, but by others alſo unto whomſoever they ſhall by any means come. <hi>Nemo plus Juris ad alium transferre poteſt, quam ipſe habuit; No man can transfer more Right to another than he hath himſelf;</hi> ſay the firſt Founders of the Roman Laws, which <hi>Seneca</hi> thus briefly explains,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nef.</note> 
                     <hi>Nemo poteſt dare quod non habet, No man can give what he hath not.</hi> But he that firſt took them had no internal Right or Property in them; wherefore neither ſhall he have any that hath no Title to them, but what he derives from him. Now that Dominion which the ſecond or the third Occupant hath gained, we call exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; that is, ſuch an advantage that he is every where to be defended in it, by all judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power and Authority, as if he were the firſt Owner. But yet, if he plead this Right againſt him, from whom the thing was at firſt unjuſtly taken, he deals not honeſtly. For look what Anſwer ſome eminent Lawyers have given concerning a Servant,<note place="margin">L. Latrones. D. de Captivis.</note> who being firſt taken by Robbers did afterwards eſcape unto the Enemy, namely, That it was true that he was taken away,<note place="margin">Aegid.

                     </note> neither was his having been amongſt Enemies, nor that he did return back by Poſtliminy, any impediment unto him as to that thing. The very ſame Anſwer from the Law of Nature may ſerve concerning him who being taken in an unjuſt War, and afterwards either in a juſt War, or by ſome other means, comes under the power of another.

                  <head>I. Whether to hurt a publick Enemy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</head>
                  <p>WHAT we have hitherto ſaid doth moſtly appertain unto ſuch as have the ſupreme Authority in an Army, or unto ſuch as are to execute publick commands. Now we are to ſee what in a publick War may privately be done, whether we reſpect the Law of Nature, Nations, or the Divine Law. <hi>Cicero</hi> in the firſt of his Offices relates, that when <hi>Marcus</hi> the Son of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor, had liſted himſelf in the Army under <hi>Pompilius</hi> the General, that Legion in which he ſerved being disbanded; yet he for the delight he took in Arms, continuing ſtill in the Army, <hi>Cato</hi> wrote to <hi>Pompilius,</hi> deſiring him in caſe his Son would continue there, to give him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Oath; adding this reaſon, becauſe the former Oath being with that Legion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it was not lawful otherwiſe for his Son to fight the Enemy. Whereunto the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> adds the very words of <hi>Cato</hi> recited out of his Epiſtle to his Son, wherein he adviſeth him, <hi>To take heed how he engaged in Battel, for that it was not lawful for him to kill an Enemy being then no Souldier.</hi> So we read in <hi>Plutarch</hi> of one <hi>Chryſantas</hi> a Souldier under <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. Quaeſt. Rom. <hi>39. &amp;</hi> de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello.</note> who having his Sword lifted up to kill his Enemy, and hearing the Trumpet ſound a Retreat, withdrew his hand and would not hurt him (as if it were only the neceſſity of obeying his General, that could juſtifie a Souldier in killing his Enemy, without which it would be no better than Homicide.) <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, <hi>That that Souldier is uſeleſs that neglects the ſound of a Retreat.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Ira. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> Now they that conceive this to proceed only from the external Right of Nations are miſtaken. For if we reſpect that Right only,<note place="margin">Bo. 3 ch. 6. <hi>Supra l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> it is lawful for any man as to poſſeſs himſelf of his Enemies Goods (as hath been ſaid) ſo to take away his life alſo; for by that Right, <hi>Hoſtes pro nullis habentur; Enemies are not reckoned as men.</hi> This therefore that <hi>Cato</hi> adviſeth, proceeds from the Roman Military Diſcipline, which provided, That he who being a Souldier obſerved not the word of Command, though the ſucceſs were good, ſhould notwithſtanding be put to Death (as <hi>Modestinus</hi> obſerves:) But he that without order or command ſhould engage in fight with an Enemy, was ſo underſtood as if he wilfully diſobeyed his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals command;<note place="margin">Livy lib. <hi>7.</hi> Plut. paral. Rom. <hi>&amp;.</hi> Grae. paral. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> as we are taught, as well by the ſeverity of <hi>Manlius</hi> to his own Son, as by the like proceedings of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> againſt his. Becauſe in caſe ſuch things may raſhly be done, it may happen that Souldiers may ſometimes deſert their own ſtations; which licence encreaſing, the whole Army or ſome part thereof, may happen to be unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly engaged on terms very unequal, which by all means is to be avoided: which is the reaſon why <hi>Acidius Caſſius</hi> paſt the ſentence of Death in the like caſe, <hi>Evenire potuit ut eſſent infidiae; It might have ſo happened,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ambuſhes had been laid to the deſtruction of the Army.</hi> And therefore <hi>Saluſt</hi> in his deſcription of the Roman Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, tells us, <hi>That in War, as well they who contrary to command had fought the Enemy, as they who being called back made not their return in time, were frequently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi> A certain Spartan being juſt about to kill his Enemy whom he had in his Power, hearing the Trumpet ſounding a Retreat, ſuddenly ſtaid his hand, giving this reaſon for it, <hi>Praefectis parêre ſatius eſt quàm hoſtem occidere; Better it is to obey our Commanders than to kill our Enemy.</hi> And <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives this as the reaſon, why he that is diſmiſt the Army, hath no Right to kill an Enemy, becauſe he is not bound by any Military Laws, which they that are to fight the Enemy are obliged to obſerve.<note place="margin">17.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Epictetus</hi> in <hi>Arrian,</hi> reciting the fact before-mentioned of <hi>Chryſantas,</hi> adds, <hi>Tanto illi potius videbatur Ducis quam ſuam voluntatem exequi; That he thought it much better to execute the commands of his Captain than to humour his own paſſion.</hi> But if we reſpect that Right which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and natural, it ſeems lawful in a juſt War for any man to do thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the innocent party may receive benefit, ſo as he exceed not the juſt meaſure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War: not that it is lawful for him to make any thing that he takes from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy his own; for to him there is not any thing owing, unleſs haply it be in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:49430:213"/> of a puniſhment, which he exacts by that Right which is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which in what meaſure it is by the Evangelical Law reſtrained, may eaſily be underſtood by what we have ſaid above.<note place="margin">

                  <head>II. What Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madoes and Privateers may do by internal Right againſt an Enemy.</head>
                  <p>A ſpecial charge or command to kill an Enemy may be given, not only to them who receive pay, but to thoſe who go to War on their own charge; or (which is yet more) who adminiſter upon their own charge a part of the War, as they that build, ſet out, and maintain men of War at their own private charge, who inſtead of pay, gain to themſelves whatſoever they can take from the Enemy, as is elſewhere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="†" place="margin">Bo. 3. ch. 6.</note>: which how far it is agreeable to that which we call internal juſtice, is worthily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. This juſtice hath reſpect, either to the Enemy, or to the City, with which we make our Contract. From an Enemy, the poſſeſſion of all things that may conduce to the maintenance of the War, may for our own ſecurity be taken away, but this muſt be under a condition of reſtitution; but the Dominion or property in thoſe things muſt be no farther retained, than will ſerve to compenſate the coſts and damages which that City that maintains the War hath been at, either from the beginning, or in the proſecution of the War; whether the things ſo taken, belong to the Commonwealth that is at enmity with us, or ſome private Citizens thereof, though haply of themſelves they are innocent: but the goods of ſuch of their Subjects as are nocent, or in actual Arms againſt us, may be taken and detained by way of juſt puniſhment. Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken from the Enemy may be theirs, who at their own charge maintain part of the War in reſpect of the Enemy, ſo far forth as to ballance their damages and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, with ſome allowance for the peril they undergo, which alſo ought to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by equal Arbitrators.</p>

But if the Booty hoped for, do in value ſurmount the charge and danger, the overplus ought to be reſtored to the City; juſt as he that buying at a low prize, the caſt of a Net, which though uncertain, yet is eaſily made, and yet of great hopes (if it anſwer his expectation, is bound to give to him with whom he did contract, ſo much as to make the ballance even.)</p>

                  <p>But ſuppoſe that what we do thus take, be no more than what in ſtrictneſs of juſtice we may keep, yet may we thereby break the bonds of charity, wherein, as Chriſtians we ſtand obliged; as in caſe it appear, that the Booty ſo taken, doth not impoveriſh the Commonwealth or the King that maintains the War, or thoſe particular perſons that are in actual Arms againſt us; but rather ſuch particular perſons as are innocent, who likewiſe are thereby reduced into ſo miſerable a condition, that in caſe we ſhould caſt thoſe who are privately indebted unto us into the like, we ſhould be thought unmercifully cruel. Whereunto if we likewiſe add, that the ſpoil we take from theſe, contributes little or nothing, either to the finiſhing of the War, or to the enfeebling of the Enemies ſtrength, it will eaſily convince us that it would ill become an honeſt man, much leſs a Chriſtian, to make an advantage to himſelf by the ſole infelicity of the times.

Neither muſt we think that becauſe (as many Authours hold) it is lawful, or at leaſt blameleſs, to deceive an Enemy by falſehood; therefore by a parity of reaſon the ſame may be done, though we have given our faith. For the obligation of ſpeaking truth proceeds from a cauſe long preceding any War, and which may haply be in ſome meaſure relaxed by War; but a promiſe doth of it ſelf confer a new Right: which difference was clearly diſcerned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who treating of veracity thus diſtinguiſheth, <hi>I ſpeak not of him who ſpeaketh truth in ordinary Contracts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, and in thoſe which appertain unto Juſtice and Injuſtice; which are indeed Branches of another Vertue. Pauſanias,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> gives of him this Character, <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can well ſtyle him a good Emperour, as being (indeed) always regardleſs of his Oaths, though made by the Immortal Gods, and upon every ſlight advantage faithleſs in his promiſes; ſo that, though a King, no man was leſs to be believed, either upon his Word or Oath, than himſelf.</hi> The like teſtimony doth <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> give of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> namely, <hi>That as profeſt an Enemy as he was to the people of</hi> Rome <hi>and all the Italians, yet was he a much greater Enemy to faith and ſincerity, rejoycing always in falſhood and lies, as if they had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Vertues; whereby it came to paſs, That whereas he had otherwiſe bequeathed unto the World an honourable memory of himſelf, he hereby left it diſputable, Whether his Vices did not exceed his Vertues.</hi> Thus the Trojans in <hi>Homer,</hi> being prick'd in conſcience by reaſon of their perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, condemn themſelves:

                  <p>But let us now ſee what more probable Argument than thoſe brought by <hi>Cicero</hi> may be produced. The firſt whereof is this, That ſuch as are notoriouſly wicked, and are no part of a Civil Society, may by the Law of Nature be by any man puniſhed, as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed. But they that may lawfully be puniſhed, even with death, may alſo be lawfully diſpoiled of their Goods, and diſpoſſeſt of their other Rights: as the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> well obſerves,<note place="margin">Offic. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

Whereunto I anſwer, That all this may be very true, if we did not knowingly treat with him as ſuch: But in caſe we treat with a Thief, as ſuch, we are ſo to be underſtood as if we were contented to remit the puniſhment due, as to that offence; becauſe, as we have elſewhere ſaid, promiſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be taken in ſuch a ſenſe, as that we make not the act void.

                  <p>But a greater difficulty than any before mentioned may ariſe from the Legiſlative Power, and from that ſupereminent Right of Dominion which every City hath over the things of their Citizens, and which is exerciſed in its name by him who hath the Supreme Power therein: Which ſupereminent Right, if it extend it ſelf to all that is the Subjects, why ſhould it not likewiſe unto that Right which ariſeth from any promiſe made in War? Which being granted, then it ſhould ſeem that all ſuch Promiſes and Agreements may be null'd, and ſo all hopes of concluding a War, unleſs by Victory, would be loſt. But on the contrary, we muſt obſerve, That this ſuperlative Right is not fit to be put in execution promiſcuouſly, at all times; but ſo far forth as it is commonly expedient to the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publick ſafety in a Government not Tyrannical, but Civil, yea even Regal. But for the moſt part it is commonly expedient, That all ſuch Promiſes and Agreements ſhould be fulfilled.

But ſo were neither the <hi>Aediles,</hi> Judges, nor <hi>Decemviri;</hi> and yet to injure either of theſe was puniſhable by the Laws. The ground of which difference was this, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe latter were thought ſufficiently defended by the ſeverity of the Laws alone. But that which was in the laſt place enacted by the people was moſt inviolable, yet whilſt the Law remained in force, no man could pretend to a Right to act contrary to the Laws. But that which defended the Tribunes, beſides the Law, was the publick Religion of the Romans; for they were all bound by a ſolemn Oath not to offer violence unto them, which they that took, could not break without giving a publick ſcandal to their Religion. This light we receive from a place in <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis,</hi> where it is thus recorded, Brutus <hi>calling the Aſſembly together, propoſed it to the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>That the Tribunes of the People might thenceforth be rendred inviolable, not by the Laws only, but by a publick Oath, whereunto all the People gave conſent.</hi> And hence it was that this Law was called <hi>ſacred.</hi>

                  <p>But as whatſoever is contended for by a wager at Law cannot whilſt the Suit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends be counterballanced againſt that which is promiſed, whether it be the thing ſued for, or the coſts and damages ſuſtained in the Suit; ſo neither can the injuries that firſt occaſioned the War, nor any of the loſſes or expences which are uſually through the licence in War cauſed, be recompenced as long as the War laſts. For the very nature of this buſineſs, leſt nothing at all be done, ſhews that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a part on either ſide the controverſies of the War, they are agreed. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can be no Agreement ſo firmly made, that may not be avoided.

Surely in the firſt place, Whatſoever by any other Contract made ſince the War is owing unto us by him to whom our promiſe was made, or whatſoever damages we have ſuſtained by him in the times of Truces, or in caſe the Perſons or Rights of Ambaſſadors have been by him violated, or, in brief, if he have done any other thing which between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies is not juſtifiable by the Law of Nations, where this alſo is to be underſtood, That the ſatisfaction be made between the ſame perſons, and that the Right of no third perſon be thereby injured; but yet with this allowance, That the Goods of Citizens may ſtand obliged for the Debts of their own City, as thoſe of Subjects may for the Debt of their Prince; as we have already ſhewed.

                  <p>ALL agreements between Enemies depend upon Faith, either expreſt or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Faith expreſt is either publick or private. Publick, is either that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by ſupreme, or that given by ſubordinate power. That given by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, either puts an end to the War, or is of ſome force, the War continuing. Among thoſe things that conclude a War, ſome things are looked at as Principals, and ſome Acceſſaries. The principals are thoſe very things that finiſh it, either by their own act, as the Articles of agreement; or by conſent on both ſides, that it ſhall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome other thing; or by Lots, by the event of ſome Combats, the award of Arbitrators: whereof that by Lots is altogether fortuitous, the other two moderate the caſe by the ſtrength of the mind, or of the body, or by the diſcerning faculty.</p>

                  <p>For in caſe a King be not at Years of diſcretion (which in ſome Kingdoms is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable by Law<note n="*" place="margin">Bo. 1. ch 3. §. 24. <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priſoner to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>Spain</hi>) his caſe about the Dutchy of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi> See Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> Hiſt. of <hi>H.</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pag. 193.</note>, but in others by probable conjectures) or if he be not of ſound mind, he is not capable of making Peace. The like may be ſaid of a King that is in Captivity; in caſe that Kingdom had its firſt riſe from the ſuffrages of the People, it being incredible that the People ſhould ever conſent to entruſt their Government into ſuch hands, as were not at liberty to exerciſe it; wherefore in this caſe alſo, though not the full power, yet the exerciſe of that power, and as it were the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of it is in the people, or thoſe whom the people ſhall ſurrogate in their ſtead. Thus when <hi>Rodolfus</hi> the Palatine fled through fear into <hi>England,</hi> and when the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> was driven out of his Territories, by the Biſhop of <hi>Tryers;</hi> neither the one nor the other loſt their Electorſhip. But yet as to thoſe things that are privately his own, a King though a Captive may make any Contract good, after the example of thoſe things that we ſhall ſay concerning private agreements. But what if the King be an exile (as <hi>Camillus</hi> was when he lived amongſt the Vejans of whom <hi>Lucan</hi> writes thus,

                     </q> is it in his power to make Peace? yea ſurely, if it appear that he lives free, obnoxious to none; for otherwiſe the condition of an exiled King is not much different from that of another Captive, a baniſhed man being but a Priſoner at large. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Regulus,</hi> that he refuſed to give his opinion in the Senate; alledging, that ſo long as he ſtood bound to his Enemies by Oath, he was uncapable of voting as a Senator.</p>

                  <p>Now let us ſee what manner of things they are that are ſubject to ſuch agreements; moſt Kings now a days, becauſe they hold not their whole Kingdoms, nor any part of them in propriety, but in reſpect of their fruits and profits only, cannot by any Contract or Agreement alienate them<note n="*" place="margin">See above Bo. 2. ch. 6. §. 3. and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</note>. Yea, and before they receive that great charge of the Empire upon them (during which time the People are as yet above them) all ſuch acts of alienating the Kingdom or any part thereof, may by a publick Law for the future be made abſolutely void, ſo that as to what concerns That, they ſhall not be
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:49430:218"/> binding at all. And credible it is that the People were generally thus minded, <hi>Ne alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui ſi ad id quod intereſt ſalva eſſet actio contrahenti, ſubditorum bona pro debito regis caperentur; Leſt otherwiſe if as to that which is ſo provided againſt the action ſhould hold good to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon contracting, the goods of the Subjects might be taken for the Debt of the King:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently this caution of not alienating the Kingdom would be in vain. But that the whole Empire may be firmly alienated, the whole body of the People muſt yield their conſents, which may quickly be done by their Repreſentatives, which are the three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or States of a Commonwealth; namely the Clergy, Peers, and the Commons: But that any part of the Empire may be firmly alienated, a twofold conſent is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; firſt of the whole, but more eſpecially of that power which is to be alienated, which cannot be ſevered from the body whereunto it grew againſt its will. This was the French Kings Plea why he would not deliver <hi>Burgundy</hi> as he had upon his Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed and promiſed. But yet in a caſe of extreme neceſſity, and otherwiſe unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That very part may firmly conveigh away the Government over themſelves unto any other without the conſent of the People; becauſe credible it is, that when that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was inſtituted, this power was reſerved. But in Kingdoms that are Patrimonial, what ſhould hinder a King from alienating his Kingdom I know not; but yet ſuch the caſe may be, that ſuch a King hath no power to alienate any part thereof, as if he received the whole as his propriety upon this condition that he ſhould not divide it. But as concerning thoſe things which are called the goods of the Kingdom, theſe may alſo become the Kings Patrimony two ways, either as ſeparable from the Kingdom, or as inſeparably united unto it: if this latter way, they may be tranſcribed,<note place="margin">See Bo. 2. ch. 15.</note> but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with the Kingdom; if the former, they may be alienated without it.

For for this Cauſe is every Peace made, That the Subjects on both ſides might live ſecure; it being an act of the City or Commonwealth, in behalf of the whole, and of every of its parts; yea and although there were a new cauſe of War, yet by Peace it ſhall be lawful for every man to defend both himſelf, and whatſoever is his. <hi>By Armes to defend our ſelves against Armes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſſius, is that Right which Nature hath given us:</hi> Which Right cannot eaſily be preſumed to be renounced amongſt Equals. But to revenge our own private Quarrels, or to recover by force what hath been taken away, is not lawful, unleſs judgment be firſt denied us: for this will admit of delay, but that of none.

According to which natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, do the Roman Laws proceed concerning ſuch acts of cruelty as are done againſt Servants; as Adultery and Raviſhment are imputed rather to acts of unbridled luſt than of hatred; and ſo the invading of another mans Right is adjudged as an act of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, rather than of Treachery.

Now he that ſhall in this caſe adventure his life by any means, whereby he conceives any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hopes to prevail, muſt needs be innocent, or at leaſt ſo reputed. But yet we cannot deny, but that many things, though not exactly done, yet may be by others, if not well approved of, yet permitted for the prevention of greater miſchiefs, which could not otherwiſe be avoided. Like as in many places, griping Uſury and publick Stews are at this Day tolerated. Wherefore in that caſe formerly put, of two perſons pretending with equal titles to one Kingdom which cannot be divided, if they ſhall offer to try their fortunes in ſuch a Combate, the people may ſafely permit them for the prevention of a more general calamity, which muſt otherwiſe neceſſarily enſue. The like may be ſaid where ſuch a Combate may put an end to any bloody War.

                     </note>, he that forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ground ſhall retreat either within his own Bounds, or unto places of ſtrength, is ſaid to be conquered.

                     </note> Neither were the Corinthians routed by the Corcyreans, but having fought it out gallantly, and perceiving a ſtrong Fleet of the Athenians near them, without endangering their Forces with the Athenians; they made a ſafe retreat.

                  <p>Concerning Arbiters, <hi>Proculus</hi> informs us, That they are of two ſorts, whereof the one he makes ſo Authoritative; that whether his award be juſt or unjuſt it muſt be obeyed: which (ſaith he) is to he obſerved whenſoever both Parties do engage themſelves to ſtand to the determination of a third perſon. The other he makes to be leſs binding; as when both Parties are content to refer their Caſe to be moderated by ſome indifferent perſon: An example whereof we have in that Anſwer of <hi>Celſus, If the Servant, being made free, ſhall ſwear to perform ſuch ſervices as his Patron ſhall think fit to impoſe upon him, the impoſition of the Patron ſhall not be binding, unleſs what he impoſeth be equal.</hi> But this interpretation of an Oath, though haply it might be warranted by the Roman Laws, yet can it not agree with the plain and genuine ſenſe of the words ſimply taken. But yet this is very true, That the word [Arbiter] may be taken in both ſenſes, either for a Moderator only, ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians were between the Rhodians and <hi>Demetrius;</hi> or for an abſolute Judge, whoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence muſt be obeyed.

But this cannot be between Kings or between Nations, for here can be no ſuperiour Power that can either hinder or diſſolve the obliging power of the promiſe.

                  <p>There is alſo an aſſuming of an Arbiter, but of another kind; when a man yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the judgment of his very Enemy, which is a pure and abſolute ſurrender, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes himſelf a Slave, and gives his Enemy Sovereign Power over him. Thus the Aetolians in <hi>Livy</hi> were demanded in the Senate, Whether they would ſubmit themſelves to the Judgment of the Romans. This was the advice of <hi>L. Cornelius Lentulus,</hi>

Neither ſhall they call this a League, for the difference between a League and this is great. For if we enter into a League with them, they will never want ſome plauſible excuſe to break it, alledging, That they had been firſt injured in ſome part of it; for ſeeing that many words in that League will admit of a doubtful interpretation, they can never want a pretence that have a mind to cavil. But when we ſhall have diſarmed them as Priſoners, and made them our Slaves, then at length they will perceive, That they have nothing that is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own; and then they will deſpond, and whatſoever we ſhall afterwards give them they will thankfully accept of, as of a mere gratuity.</hi> But here alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh between what the Conquered ought to ſuffer, what the Conquerour by the Right of his Conqueſt may do, and laſtly, what moſt of all becomes him. The Conquered Party having yielded themſelves, ought to ſuffer whatſoever the Conquerour will impoſe upon them; for being perfectly inſlaved, if we reſpect that Right of War that is external, they have nothing

                  <p>But the Conquerour, that he may do nothing unjuſtly, ought in the firſt place to take care that no mans life be taken from him, unleſs it be for ſome crime that deſerves death. As alſo that no mans Goods be taken from him, unleſs it be by way of a juſt puniſhment. For in the Conqueror there is nothing ſo honourable, nor in ſome Caſes ſo neceſſary, as in this manner to extend his clemency and liberality to the Conquered, ſo far forth as it may ſtand with his own ſecurity.<note place="margin">See Book 3. Chap. 15. in finem.</note> When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſubdued the Aſſyrians, he comforted them by this aſſurance, <hi>That their Condition ſhould be the ſame that before it was, their Houſes, Lands, Wives and Children, they ſhould freely enjoy; and in Caſe any perſonal injuries were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, both he and his would readily defend them.</hi> Admirable are the effects of thoſe Wars that are concluded with a general pardon. Thus did <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Syracuſian plead in <hi>Diodorus</hi> in the behalf of thoſe that had yielded to mercy, <hi>They have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and given up their Armes, relying wholly on the Conquerours clemency:</hi> Quare indignum foret, eos decipi ſpe noſtrae humanitatis; <hi>Wherefore it would be an everlaſting diſhonour to us to ſuffer them to be deceived in their confidence they have of our clemency.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Who amongſt all the Grecians did ever inexorably condemn them to puniſhment, who yielded themſelves to the Conquerours mercy. Appian</hi> brings in <hi>Octavius Caeſar</hi> thus beſpeaking <hi>L. Antonius,</hi> when he came to ſurrender himſelf, <hi>If the end of thy coming hither had been to purchaſe thy Peace only, thou hadſt found me, not only a Conquerour, but ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour as was throughly incenſed by the wrongs thou haſt done; but ſince thou art come to yield thy ſelf, thy Friends, and thine Armes to our diſcretion, thou haſt appeaſed mine anger, and taken away from me that power I had to have enforced thee to have accepted of what Conditions I pleaſed. For I am now to weigh, not ſo much what thou deſerveſt to ſuffer, as what becomes me to grant; wherefore I ſhall chuſe rather to conſult mine own honour by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, than to gratifie my paſſion by a juſt revenge.</hi> We do often meet with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Roman Stories, namely, That the Conquered do yield themſelves ſometimes to the faith, ſometimes to the mercy or clemency, of the Conqueror. As in <hi>Livy, To thoſe Ambaſſadours that were ſent from the Neighbour Provinces to ſurrender their Cities to the faith of the Romans, he gave a gracious Audience.</hi> So in another place, ſpeaking of King <hi>Perſeus,</hi> he ſaith, Paulus <hi>earneſtly labouring that he might be permitted to ſurrender both himſelf and whatſoever was his, to the faith and clemency of the People of</hi> Rome: Whereby nothing elſe is to be underſtood but an abſolute rendition. For the word [Faith] in this and the like places, ſignifies nothing but the bare honeſty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Victor, unto which the Vanquiſhed ſubmits himſelf. There is a notable Story extant both in <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> concerning one <hi>Phanea</hi> an Aetolian Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who in his Speech to the Conſul <hi>Manius</hi> let fall theſe words, <hi>That the Aetolians did freely ſurrender themſelves and all they had to the faith of the ſame People of</hi> Rome: Which (being thereunto urged by the Conſul) he re-affirmed in the very words. But when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul demanded the principal Authors of the War to be immediately delivered unto him, <hi>Phanea</hi> readily anſwered, <hi>That it was only to the faith, and not to the ſubjection, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans that they ſubmitted themſelves:</hi> Adding, That it was not the cuſtom of the Grecians to be commanded; whereunto the Conſul replied, That he cared not what the manner of the Grecians was, but the cuſtom of the Romans was to impoſe Laws upon thoſe who by their own conceſſion had ſurrendred themſelves: And immediately commanded the Ambaſſadour to be clapt up in Chains. <hi>Polybius</hi>'s words are to this ſenſe, <hi>Do ye, having newly ſurrendred your ſelves unto our trust, teach us what we muſt or ought to do?</hi> By which words it is evident what he to whoſe faith any people do commit themſelves may do with impunity, and without violating the Law of Nations. But yet the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conſuls did not make uſe of their power ſo as theſe Hiſtorians have reported, They only diſmiſt the Ambaſſadours, and gave the Aetolians longer time to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Thus did the people of <hi>Rome</hi> anſwer the <hi>Faliſci,</hi> as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <hi>That they very well underſtood that the</hi> Faliſci <hi>had ſurrendred themſelves not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power, but unto the faith of the Romans:</hi> And of the <hi>Campanes, That they had put themſelves under the Romans, not by any League but, by a voluntary ſurrender.</hi> Now
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:49430:223"/> as concerning his Duty unto whom ſuch a ſurrender is made, that of <hi>Seneca</hi> is very pertinent, <hi>Clementiae liberum arbitrium habet, The Conquerour may ſhew what clemency he pleaſeth; but yet he ought to give Sentence not as a Judge according to the rigour of Law, but according to equity and good conſcience, he may either abſolutely forgive, or he may exact whatever ſatisfaction he pleaſeth.</hi> Nor do I think it much material in what form of words ſuch a ſurrender is made, whether to the Conquerour's wiſdom, or to his moderation, or to his mercy and clemency. All theſe being but palliations, the main thing intended is, That the Conquerour muſt be Judge.</p>

                  <p>But whether it be lawful for an Hoſtage to make his eſcape, would be likewiſe enquired. Certainly it is not, if either at his firſt entrance, or at any time after, to the end that he might live under a more gentle reſtraint, he engaged his word, That he would not. Otherwiſe it was not the purpoſe of the City or State in ſending their Citizen to oblige him not to flye; but to empower the Enemy to keep him in ſuch a ſtrict cuſtody, that though he would, yet he could not fly. And thus may that Fact of <hi>Claelia</hi> be defended, who made her eſcape from <hi>Porſenna,</hi> to whom She was ſent, with other Ladies, as Hoſtages. But admit that <hi>Claelia</hi> had not at all offended in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her eſcape, yet could not the City of <hi>Rome</hi> juſtifie her reception and detenſion.

                  <p>But this kind of aſſurance by Hoſtages is to thoſe who are ſent very odious, as well by reaſon that it deprives them of their liberty, as becauſe it is occaſioned by the fact of another. Wherefore in all Caſes that are dubious, we are to underſtand it in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; as that they that are ſent as Hoſtages in one Caſe, cannot be detained as Hoſtages in another. Which is ſo to be underſtood, That when the latter Agreement was made, there was no mention at all made of thoſe Hoſtages. But if we have already broken our faith in any other Agreement, or if there be any Debt juſtly due, then thoſe Hoſtages may be detained, yet not then as Hoſtages, but as Subjects, which by the Law of Nations may be taken and kept as Priſoners for their Sovereign's Debt. Which very thing may alſo be eaſily prevented, by inſerting this Clauſe amongſt thoſe Articles, That ſo ſoon as that, for which they were ſent, ſhall be performed, thoſe Hoſtages ſhall be freely ſent back.</p>

                  <head>I. Whether a Truce be a time of Peace or War.</head>
                  <p>THERE are ſome things which Soveraign Princes even in the midſt of War, do uſually grant one to another, which <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> call, <hi>Belli Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, The Traffick of War;</hi> and in <hi>Homer</hi> are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

A Truce is an agreement, whereby though, the War continue yet, all acts of hoſtility do for a while ceaſe, though (as I ſaid) the War continue. For, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks, between War and Peace there is no <hi>Medium;</hi> it may be called a War, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at preſent its operations are intermitted: As, <hi>A man may he ſaid to be wiſe or prudent, though he be aſleep; and vertuous, though for a while he be void of action.</hi> The diſtance of place, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle, doth not diſſolve friendſhip it ſelf,</hi>

So then as <hi>Gellius</hi> ſometimes ſaid, <hi>Neque Pax est induciae; Bellum manet, pugna ceſſat: A Truce cannot be called a Peace; for though the fight ceaſe, the War continues.</hi> So <hi>Pacatus</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick, Induciae Bella ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendebant; A Truce is but the ſuſpenſion of the acts of War.</hi> Which I here the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may underſtand, That whatſoever is agreed upon to be of force during the War, is alſo of force during the time of a Truce; unleſs it plainly appear, that it was not the ſtate of War that was ſo much looked at, as the exerciſe of it. On the contrary, If any thing be agreed upon as concerning Peace, that is of no force in the time of a Truce: Neither am I ignorant that <hi>Virgil</hi> calls a Truce, <hi>Pacem ſequeſtram; An indifferent Peace, or a thing between Peace and War:</hi> And that <hi>Servius</hi> upon that place calls it a <hi>temporary Peace.</hi> As alſo doth the Scholiaſt upon <hi>Thucydides: Varro</hi> calls it

All hoſtile Acts are unlawful, whether they be done againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things. For whatſoever is by force of Armes done againſt an Enemy during a Truce is contrary to the Law of Nations, as <hi>Lucius Aemilius</hi> in <hi>Livy</hi> tells his Souldiers. Nay, whatſoever ſhall come from the Enemy accidentally into our Quarters, although it had been formerly ours, yet muſt it be reſtored; becauſe by that external Juſtice, whereby ſuch things ought to be tryed, they are the Enemies. And therefore, as <hi>Paulus</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer obſerves, the Right of Poſtliminy in the time of a Truce, is, as it were, out of date; becauſe unto this Right it is required that there ſhould precede another Right, namely, A Right to take from an Enemy by force what we can; which during a Truce cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

                  <p>A freedom to paſs to and fro when no Truce is agreed on, is a kind of priviledge, and will therefore admit of ſuch an interpretation as is already declared<note n="*" place="margin">Book 2. Ch. 16. Sect. 12.</note>, where we treated of priviledges. Now this priviledge being neither prejudicial to any third perſon, nor grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to him that granted it, is not to be underſtood in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, but with ſome allowance of favour, yet ſo that the propriety of the words will bear it; but eſpecially if it were freely offered and not granted at the requeſt of him that hath it. But much more when, beſides that which is private, there is any publick advantage to be gained thereby. We are therefore to forbear rigorouſly to interpret any ſuch Paſſes, though the words may perhaps warrant it, unleſs otherwiſe ſome great abſurdity will enſue, or that we are thereunto led by very probable conjectures, That it was ſo intended by him that gave them. On the contrary, A favourable conſtruction, even beyond the proper ſignification of the words, ſhall take place, rather than any ſuch like abſurdity ſhall be admitted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if we ſhall be thereunto induced by any ſuch probable conjectures.</p>

                  <p>Being thus awed by ſo great Authorities, I dare not abſolutely approve of thoſe Laws, which forbid the Redemption of Slaves, without a diſtinction, ſuch I mean as we may read of among the Romans, <hi>Nulli Civitati viliores Captivi quàm noſtrae; There is no City ſo regardleſs of Captives as ours,</hi> ſaith a wiſe Roman in open Senate. For which cauſe <hi>Rome</hi> is called in <hi>Livy, Civitas Captivis minime indulgens; A City ſhewing little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Captives.</hi> That Ode of <hi>Horace</hi> is very well known, where he condemns the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming of Priſoners as an opprobrious act, an example of dangerous conſequence, and is an execrable fact encouraged with a reward. But what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> blames in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conian, is alſo uſually blamed in the Roman Government, namely, that all their Polity
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:49430:227"/> tended only to the advancement of their Military Diſcipline, as if in this alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the ſafety of their Commonwealth; whereas, if we will but duly conſider it as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men, with the allowance of ſome grains of compaſſion, it would ſeem much better to rebate ſomewhat of that rigour, which the licence of War permits, than to leave ſo many of, perhaps, our Kinſmen and Countrymen in an everlaſting ſlavery. I cannot therefore conceive how ſuch a Law can be reputed juſt, unleſs it ſhall appear that ſuch a ſevere courſe is neceſſary for the prevention of far greater, and morally inevitable calamities, which will otherwiſe in all humane probability fall upon us: for in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity, as the Priſoners themſelves ought by the rules of Charity, patiently to bear their hard fortune; ſo may this puniſhment be juſtly impoſed upon them and threatned againſt others, to deter them from the like cowardize, according to what we have elſewhere written concerning any one Citizen, which for the publick ſafety of the City may be delivered up.</p>

                  <p>The ranſome agreed upon, ſhall bind the Contractors, though the Priſoner be found richer than he was thought to be, when the Contract was made; becauſe by that Right of Nations which is external, whereby we are in this caſe to be judged, no man can be compelled to give a greater price than what was firſt agreed on, although underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, if there were no fraud in the Contract, as may eaſily be underſtood by that which hath been already delivered in the Chapter of Agreements<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>From what hath been already ſaid, that Captives are not now to be made Slaves, it follows, That the Dominion that we have over their perſons, doth not give us an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Right to all that is theirs, as hath been elſewhere ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">

Whereunto the anſwer is eaſie, for if the Captive dye in Priſon, doubtleſs the ranſome is not due; becauſe the promiſe was made upon condition that the Priſoner ſhould be ſet at liberty, but he that is dead cannot be ſaid to be at liberty: But on the contrary, if being at at liberty, he ſhall dye, the ranſome ſhall be recovered, becauſe he enjoyed that for which the ranſome was promiſed; yet I confeſs the Contract may be ſo made that the ranſome ſhall be due ſimply, and immediately from the time of the Contract, and then the perſon taken ſhall not from thenceforth be held as a Priſoner of War, but as one that doth freely engage himſelf as a Surety for the payment thereof: So on the contrary, the Contract may be ſo made that the ranſome ſhall not be due, unleſs the Priſoner live and be at liberty upon a Day prefixt; but theſe things being leſs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſhall not be preſumed to be done, unleſs evidently proved.</p>

                  <p>It may likewiſe be queſtioned, whether he that is releaſed on condition, that he ſhall releaſe another, if that other dye before he be releaſed, is bound to return into Captivity. I have elſwhere<note n="*" place="margin">Bo. 2. ch. 11. §. 22. &amp; 15. and in this Book ch. 20. §. 58.</note> proved that a promiſe freely made for the Fact of a third, is ſufficiently performed if nothing be omitted by the Promiſer, in order to its accompliſhment; but if a promiſe be made upon a valuable conſideration, the Promiſer ſtands obliged to the full value of what he promiſed. Juſt ſo it is in this caſe, for he that is releaſed is not bound to return into Captivity, becauſe it was not ſo agreed upon; nor will that indulgence that is given to liberty, admit it ſo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly underſtood, neither ought any man to make a gain of another mans liberty; but yet he that is ſo diſmiſt out of Priſon, ought to pay the value of that which he could not perform.

                  <p>As concerning theſe mens engagements, there ought to be a twofold inſpection, firſt, Whether the ſupreme powers are thereby engaged; and ſecondly, Whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are bound by them. The former of theſe may be determined by what we have already ſaid, namely, That Princes may be obliged by ſuch as they depute to declare their wills, whether particularly expreſt, or collected from the nature of their office; for he that grants a power, grants as much as in him is, all things neceſſary to that power, which in moral things is morally to be underſtood: whence we may collect, That ſubordinate Commanders may oblige their Soveraigns two ſeveral ways, firſt, by doing that which in all probability belongs to their place or office; ſecondly, by doing that which belongs not to their office, yet which they have a ſpecial Commiſſion to do, in caſe that Commiſſion be either publickly known, or at leaſt unto thoſe with whom they have to do.</p>

Their conſent will appear by their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which may be given not only expreſly but tacitly; that is, when the ſupreme power had knowledge thereof, and yet permitted them to be done, which cannot with any probability be referred to any other cauſe; and how this may proceed we have elſewhere ſhewed. By the thing it ſelf he may be ſo far obliged,<note place="margin">Bo. 2. ch. 4. §. 5. <hi>&amp;.</hi> ch. 15. §. 17.</note> as not to enrich himſelf by anothers loſs; as if by an agreement made by his Miniſters, a Prince receives any benefit, he is thereby bound to perform that part of the ſaid agreement which concerns himſelf to perform; or if he refuſe to do it, then he is bound to forego the benefit, which he either hath or may receive by that agreement: for this is that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which as we have often elſewhere ſaid, evens the ſcales of juſtice. And hitherto and no farther is that ſaying true, <hi>Si quid utiliter geſtum ſit, valet; Whatſoever contract brings profit, binds the Contracter.</hi> And therefore we cannot but condemn them of injuſtice, who refuſing to fulfil the agreement, yet are reſolved to detain that, which but by that agreement they could never have had; as the Romans did when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, either to confirm the agreement made by <hi>Cnaeus Domitius,</hi> or to ſet at liberty King <hi>Bituitus,</hi> whom <hi>Domitius</hi> had firſt invited as his Gueſt, and then perfidiouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſent bound to <hi>Rome:</hi> which fact as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Senatus nec ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probare

                  <head>IV. What if any thing be done contrary to Command.</head>
                  <p>And here alſo we muſt repeat what we have formerly delivered, namely, That a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince may be obliged by the fact of his General, in caſe he tranſgreſs not the bounds of his publick Office, though he act contrary to his private inſtructions; this equity was well obſerved by the Roman Pretor, in ſuch actions as concerned Factories. For it is not every Contract made with a Factor that ſhall be binding to him that employs him; but ſuch only as are made concerning ſuch Goods for which he is appointed his Factor. But in Caſe it be publickly proclaimed, That no man ſhall thenceforth treat or make any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with ſuch a man, that man ſhall no longer be treated with as a chief Miniſter: Nay, though ſuch a Proclamation be made, yet if it appear not ſo to the Contractors, whatſoever ſhall be by him agreed on, ſhall bind the Prince that firſt employed him. Moreover, the condition of his Prepoſition ought to be obſerved; for he that is willing to be treated with under ſuch a certain condition, and by the mediation of ſuch a perſon, whatſoever is agreed upon by that perſon, in reference to the buſineſs for which he was commiſſionated, ought in all equity to be obſerved. Whence it follows, That ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or People are more, and ſome leſs, bound by ſuch Contracts as are made by their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, if their ſeveral Laws and Conſtitutions are ſufficiently known. But in Caſe theſe be not well known, then muſt we be guided by the moſt likely conjectures, which always preſume that to be within their power, without which they cannot well diſcharge the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a General. But yet if any ſuch inferior Officer ſhall tranſgreſs his Commiſſion, and promiſe more than he can perform, he himſelf ſhall be bound to the full value, unleſs ſome Law ſufficiently known ſhall hinder it. So likewiſe if there ſhall be found any fraud in the Caſe, as if ſuch a principal Commander ſhall pretend to have a greater power given him by his Prince than indeed he hath, he ſhall then be obliged to ſatisfie for the damage thereby ſuſtained; yea, and if through his crime ſome great injury do ariſe to the adverſe Party, he ſhall be bound to ſuffer puniſhments anſwerable to his crime. In the former Caſe, his Goods ſhall make ſatisfaction; and if thoſe fall ſhort, his ſervice, or his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty: In the latter, his perſon, or his Goods, or both, according to the greatneſs of his crime. Neither will it ſuffice in the Caſe of fraud to declare before-hand, that he will not oblige himſelf: For as well ſatisfaction for the damages done, as puniſhment for a crime committed, are both of them due, not by a voluntary, but by a natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

                  <p>Now becauſe in all ſuch Contracts, either the Prince or his Principal Miniſter, doth ſtand obliged; therefore it follows, That the other Party is thereby obliged; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract cannot be ſaid to halt.

                  <p>Now let us ſee what power they have over their Inferiours. And ſurely it is not to be doubted but that a General hath a power over his Souldiers, and a Magiſtrate over his Citizens, as to thoſe Acts that are uſually ſubject to their Command; but not otherwiſe, without their conſent. On the contrary, an Agreement made by a General or a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in ſuch things as are merely profitable, ſhall wholly bind their Inferiours. For this is ſufficiently warranted by their Office and Authority; yea, and in ſuch things alſo as are burthenſome and chargeable, ſo as thoſe burthens be ſuch only as have been uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted; but as to thoſe that are extraordinary, they ſtand not obliged without their own conſents and acceptance: Which things are very agreeable to what we have already from the very Law of Nature proved,<note place="margin">

                  <p>It belongs not to a General to look into the Cauſes or conſequences of a War, it being his Duty carefully to manage the War, but not to conclude it; yea, though he have the greateſt power that can be given him by his Commiſſion, yet ſhall it be underſtood of the conduct of the War only, <hi>Neque enim nos Jus habemus ordinandi res Imperatoris, For neither have we any power to diſpoſe of what only belongs to the Emperour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to the Goths.) Thus <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> anſwered the Perſians, <hi>De Pace constituendi Jus eſt penes Civitatem, It is only in the power of the Commonwealth to make Peace.</hi> And therefore the Peace which <hi>Albinus</hi> made with <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> withour Order from the Senate, the Senate broke, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> informs us. Thus likewiſe <hi>Livy, Quî rata iſta pax, quam non ex authoritate Senatus, non juſſu popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Romani peregerimus? What ſtability can there be in that Peace which is made without any Order or Decree, either of the Senate or People of</hi> Rome?

But over the reſt of the ſpoil the General hath ſome kind of Right, yet not ſo much by virtue of his Authority as by the cuſtom of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof we have diſcourſed ſufficiently before. But as to ſuch things as are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed, they are wholly in the Generals power to forgive; becauſe it is frequently ſeen, that both Men and Cities are willing to ſurrender themſelves upon condition of their lives or their liberties, or ſometimes that their Goods may be preſerved; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the preſent ſtate of things will not permit ſo much delay, as to expect the Prince or the Peoples pleaſure. And by a parity of reaſon, the ſame power may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an inferiour Commander concerning ſuch things as are particularly committed to his Conduct. There were ſome Roman Souldiers that had eſcaped out of the Battel at <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſymenes,</hi> to whom <hi>Maharbal</hi> in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s abſence had granted leave to depart, not with life only, but, laying down their Armes, unſtript; whom notwithſtanding <hi>Hannibal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, pretending, That <hi>Maharbal</hi> had no power to grant ſuch a Paſs without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

                  <p>THAT Saying of <hi>Cicero</hi> is very well known, <hi>Etiam, ſi quid ſinguli, temporibus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducti Hoſti promiſerint, eſt in eo ipſo Fides ſervanda; Whatſoever any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being urged by the neceſſity of the times, ſhall promiſe to his Enemy, even in that very thing ought he to preſerve his Faith.</hi> Now whereas he ſaith <hi>[any private perſon]</hi> it is plain that it matters not whether he be a Souldier or a Citizen; for Faith ought to be kept with an Enemy by both.

In our days the hanging forth of a white Flagg is a tacite ſign that a Treaty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: So among the Northern Nations is the kindling of a fire, as <hi>Johannes Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> relates.<note place="margin">Pliny l. <hi>15.</hi> c. <hi>30.</hi>
